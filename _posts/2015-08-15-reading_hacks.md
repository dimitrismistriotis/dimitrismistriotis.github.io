# Reading Hacks
or "*my reading more how-to*"

This post is inspired from FightMediocrity's YouTube channel video
"[How I read two to three books every
week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qARv-vEh2o8)". Great content, wanted to
give back and also revise my techniques. This post is a follow up to the
author's call: *"So if any of you have advice on how you do things that can
help me, and not only just me but everyone else in regards to this, please
share so everyone can benefit."*

## Choosing different techniques

Those hacks are similar to setting up a personal working environment where
things work differently for different people. So in theory no two people should
find the exact same elements or the same mix being equally effective for them.
As an example most developers I know use a different colour combination for
highlighting source code. What is common here is that everyone looked out,
tried different things and made a choice that suits himself. This indicates
how I would suggest to use this post: copy a lot from different places, but at
the end of the day end up with something that serves you best.

Something related with skill acquisition and retention would be suggesting
adopting one technique at a time, integrating it, then picking up another one
and so forth. Even if 100% of the stuff below makes sense, adopting all of
them might trigger regression or limited results.

## The hacks

Need to state again that the ordering is In loose order of personal importance
and preference. For each person the order of importance or which to choose to
adopt is different.

## Read it when you need it

The “drink water when thirsty” approach. This piece of advice originates from
start-up literature: It is better to engage with content close to when it is
needed in order to achieve a task. This will keep the brain active and will
allow higher absorbency rates.

An example from my experience would be reading Noam Wassermann’s “The founder’s
dilemmas”, which has lots of statistical analysis on various start-up companies
and what they encounter, one chapter is about stuffing. I read that book while
in a start-up scenario we would be in the process of discussing if a person
should be hired and what characteristics that person should have as well as
other aspects such as compensation versus equity. Maybe I achieved the highest
pages per day ratio ever.

So the hack would be summarised to: Identify a gap that needs to be addressed
in the near future, then engage with material related to that gap.

## Read it when you want it

The second strongest force after necessity should be desire or curiosity. This
applies both for fiction and non-fiction titles: identify things that are of
interest to you and engage when you feel like it. Try to avoid what is
currently popular or trending on the web or hip, unless it has to do with your
interests.

Example: I have a semi-professional interest in advertising and generally in
the arts of mass-persuasion . I was lucky enough to win a copy of Byron Sharp’s
"[how brands grow”](http://marketinglawsofgrowth.com/)". It immediately became
the next item of my list. If I realise that I ended up not so interested in the
subject, it would have probably been passed to someone that might like or need
it more.

## Read actively

Advice from Tim Feriss from the "[4 hour week](http://www.amazon.co.uk/4-Hour-Work-Week-Escape-Anywhere/dp/0091929113/)":

![How to read faster first part](/images/reading_hacks/how_to_read-pt1.jpg "How to read faster first part")
![How to read faster second part](/images/reading_hacks/how_to_read-pt2.jpg "How to read faster second part")

or this YouTube video: [How to Triple Your Reading Speed in 20 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeOHqI9SqOI), or the associated blog post: [Learn How to Triple Your Reading Speed in 5 Minutes](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/06/09/speed-reading/).

Following lines with the finger tracing provided a great speed multiplier and
focus assistance even when some distractions were around. Then adjusting the
eyes as advised provided an additional incremental improvement.

In order to be active and engaged some prefer a pen or marker to underline
passages. An compartmental approach is to use post-its on pages. I have seen
the latter also as a substitution for underlining for whoever does not want to
"damage" the book.

## Make time

Making small rearrangements of daily schedule can often create pockets of time
for extra reading. As an example while in London using the underground:
starting the commute from a different station added 5 minutes to the journey
but eliminated one train exchange. This created a 25 minute continuous commute
back and forth, totalling to almost an hour for reading each working day.

## It is OK to quit or stop

This hack is again from a person from the IT start-up scene whom I cannot
remember: If at any given point while reading you feel like doing something
else, then stop. Do what you have to and then come back or leave it for another
day.

I would extend this suggesting that it is OK to stop reading books if they end
up not interesting or if the mood about them changes. This happened with the
third part of the Dune series: I wanted to read more about the sands of the
planet Arrakis, but after following up from volume two I just could not follow
through. I dropped the book immediately and will probably pick it up at some
point in the future. A close friend always reads books up to their last page no
matter what.  After trying to do the same, I found myself not wanting to read
anything significant for a couple of weeks.

The above should not become a habit of starting something and never finishing.
The tactic should exist as a tool, but one of the tools that are not used
often.

### Rule 50 to the rescue

Rule 50 is stolen from author of "Steal like an artist", Austin Kleon (I'm
doing what you taught me Austin), who in turn got was quoting [Nancy Pearl](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1570613818?tag=wwwaustinkleo-20&camp=213381&creative=390973&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=1570613818&adid=01KSY62GYJMEMERS92YW&):

*"Believe me, nobody is going to get any points in heaven by slogging their way
through a book they aren’t enjoying but think they ought to read. I live by what
I call ‘the rule of fifty,’ which acknowledges that time is short and the world
of books is immense. If you’re fifty years old or younger, give every book about
fifty pages before you decide to commit yourself to reading it, or give it up.
If you’re over fifty, which is when time gets even shorter, subtract your age
from 100. The result is the number of pages you should read before deciding."*

## Prefer paperbacks

Paperbacks have some advantages: They are easier to carry around because of
weight and size. This means it is easier to utilise opportunities to read,
hence one can read more. Because of the lower price, there is less guilt in
“book abuse”: underlining, sticking post-its, having coffee spill over in a
coffee shop etc.

There is another factor that contributes to reading paperbacks: they can be
purchased from alternative sources. Remember the 3rd book of the Dune series
mentioned before? It was purchased from a Christian charity from the US for
about £2.50 which is the cost of one cup of coffee in a UK café. This means
that there is both the contribution to the charity as well as that stop reading
it was associated with a £2.50 “loss”, which would be easier than doing the
same to a £30 hard-copy.

### But I hate paperbacks and I love my kindle

... and that's OK. What this section wants to convey is more something in the
lines of *"Choose your preferred medium"*. Whichever works best.

## Alternate between "fact" and "fiction" titles

Maybe the most “personal” one, in the area that it might not be applicable to
everyone. Alternating between fiction and non fiction titles helps to: enjoy
reading more leading to generally reading more, introduce new concepts,
cultivate my English.

## (and/or) Read more than one book concurently

Inspired from "[How to read a book](http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=56217f3273816b2f6aa899689&id=ea0ae1292b&utm_content=buffer58eb1&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)" by Tobias van Schneider, rule number 2: *"Start reading 3-4 books at the same time, I rotate either depending on the day or on the mood I’m in."*

I had been exposed to this advice from different sources but after reading it there I decided to do a little experiment by reading two books in parallel ... and it worked! Possibly this has to do with shifting gears in the mind and participating in different universes, one for each book. Possible fatigue from concentrating on something specific can be mitigated by checking out somethingdifferent.

The variation that I tried this time was to read a non-fiction book and a graphic novel in parallel. I've almost finished both on the time I would need for each one say plus 30/40%. Another approach that I tried in the past was to have one book for the commute, in the bag, and another one at home, for the sofa.

## Buy now to read later

Alternatively bookmark when on-line, write down the title in a notepad,
generally archive details. Buy now/read later applies more for items that are
either rare or in sale or for any reason attractive to purchase. You see
the volume that you want to read a bench selling for £2: Can be purchased on
the spot and be read in a year.

Alternatively archiving/bookmarking so that the information can be referenced
back. One "app for that" is Google's
[Keep](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep)
which can store both photos and text in post-it format.

After the death of Umberto Eco, this comment from Nassim Nicholas Taleb after visiting Eco's house surfaced:

Let's listen to the masters!

## Utilise a different approach for non-fiction material

I recently discovered from Hacker News the "How to Read a Book" paper from Paul N. Edwards, School of Information University of Michigan.

For when you want to *""discover, understand, and remember"* or when *"The purpose of
reading things like this is to gain, and retain, information. Here, finding out
what happens — as quickly and easily as possible — is your main goal. So unless
you’re stuck in prison with nothing else to do, **NEVER** read a non-fiction book or
article from beginning to end."*

I would suggest to read the whole paper in detail, which can be found [here](http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/howtoread.pdf) and the [comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12209446) in Hacker News.

The points of the paper summarised in a diagram are:

| Strategies    and    techniques | Rationale |
|:------------------------------- |:----------|
| Read    the    whole    thing | Major arguments and evidence matter more than details. Grasping the structure of the whole is more important than reading every word. |
| Decide how much time you will spend | Real world time is limited. If you know exactly how long you can actually spend on reading, you can plan how much time to devote to each item. |
| Have a purpose and a strategy | You'll enjoy reading more, and remember it better, if you know exactly why you're reading. |
| Read actively | Never rely on the author's structures alone. Move around in the text, following your own goals. |
| Read it three times | First time for overview and discovery. Second time for detail and understanding. Third time for note taking in your own words. |
| Focus on parts with high information content | Tables of contents, pictures, charts, headings, and other elements contain more information than body text. |
| Use PTML (personal text markup language) | Mark up your reading with your own notes. This helps you learn and also helps you find important passages later. |
| Know the author(s) and organizations | Authors are people with backgrounds and biases. They work in organizations that give them context and depth. |
| Know the intellectual context | Most academic writing is part of an ongoing intellectual conversation, with debates, key figures, and paradigmatic concepts. |
| Use your unconscious mind | Leave time between reading sessions for your mind to process the material. |
| Rehearse, and use multiple modes | Talking, visualizing, or writing about what you've read helps you remember it |

## Admit it and accept it

Placed it as the last one to demonstrate that the above hacks are of different
importance to each one. For some this could be the first step.

Admit first to yourself that reading is one of the ways to educate and inform
yourself. Then that this is not everyone's choice and that's OK. There are
people that learn through different media or are just reading-intolerant. There
are also people that want to evolve and people that feel fine as they are.

I could have not stated it better than Malkhaz Geldiashvili who inspired me to
write this post, quoting his YouTube video transcript:

*“So the two issues that I come across with this: The first one is, I always
have one person tell me, ‘**That’s too much**. Why are you straining yourself,
dude? Like that’s way too much.’ And they say something like, ‘I read a couple
of books every year, and I’m fine with that.’ And that’s OK. I’m not going to
criticize that, but that’s what I do when I play tennis for example. So I play
tennis a couple of times a month, but I would never go up to a professional
tennis player, who’s passionate about what he does, and tell him, ‘Dude, why
are you straining yourself? You know, just relax. You don’t have to practice
that much.’ You know, it’s the exact same thing. … I’ve read many books and
I’ve listened to many books, and I can tell you there is pretty much no real
difference in doing either one. And you have **nothing to be ashamed of**.”*
