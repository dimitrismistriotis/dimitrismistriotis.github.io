# Reading Hacks
or *How I read*

This post is inspired from FightMediocrity's YouTube channel video
"[How I read two to three books every 
week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qARv-vEh2o8)". Great content, wanted to
give back and also revise my techniques. This post is a follow up to the
author's call: *"So if any of you have advice on how you do things that can
help me, and not only just me but everyone else in regards to this, please 
share so everyone can benefit."*

## Choosing different techniques

Those hacks are similar to setting up a personal working environment where
things work differently for different people. So in theory no two people should
find the exact same elements or the same mix being equally effective for them.
As an example most developers I know use a different colour combination for 
highlighting source code. What is common here is that everyone looked out,
tried different things and made a choice that suits himself. This indicates 
how I would suggest to use this post: copy a lot from different places, but at 
the end of the day end up with something that serves you best.

Something related with skill acquisition and retention would be suggesting
adopting one technique at a time, integrating it, then picking up another one
and so forth. Even if 100% of the stuff below makes sense, adopting all of
them might trigger regression or limited results.

## The hacks

Need to state again that the ordering is In loose order of personal importance
and preference. For each person the order of importance or which to choose to
adopt is different.

## Read it when you need it

The “drink water when thirsty” approach. This piece of advice originates from
start-up literature: It is better to engage with content close to when it is
needed in order to achieve a task. This will keep the brain active and will
allow higher absorbency rates.

An example from my experience would be reading Noam Wassermann’s “The founder’s
dilemmas”, which has lots of statistical analysis on various start-up companies
and what they encounter, one chapter is about stuffing. I read that book while
in a start-up scenario we would be in the process of discussing if a person
should be hired and what characteristics that person should have as well as
other aspects such as compensation versus equity. Maybe I achieved the highest
pages per day ratio ever.

So the hack would be summarised to: Identify a gap that needs to be addressed
in the near future, then engage with material related to that gap.

## Read it when you want it

The second strongest force after necessity should be desire or curiosity. This
applies both for fiction and non-fiction titles: identify things that are of
interest to you and engage when you feel like it. Try to avoid what is
currently popular or trending on the web or hip, unless it has to do with your
interests.

Example: I have a semi-professional interest in advertising and generally in
the arts of mass-persuasion . I was lucky enough to win a copy of Byron Sharp’s
"[how brands grow”](http://marketinglawsofgrowth.com/)". It immediately became
the next item of my list. If I realise that I ended up not so interested in the
subject, it would have probably been passed to someone that might like or need
it more.

## Read actively

Advice from Tim Feriss from the "[4 hour week](http://www.amazon.co.uk/4-Hour-Work-Week-Escape-Anywhere/dp/0091929113/)":

or this YouTube video: [How to Triple Your Reading Speed in 20 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeOHqI9SqOI), or the associated blog post: [Learn How to Triple Your Reading Speed in 5 Minutes](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/06/09/speed-reading/).

Following lines with the finger tracing provided a great speed multiplier and
focus assistance even when some distractions were around. Then adjusting the
eyes as advised provided an additional incremental improvement.

In order to be active and engaged some prefer a pen or marker to underline
passages. An compartmental approach is to use post-its on pages. I have seen
the latter also as a substitution for underlining for whoever does not want to
"damage" the book.

## Make time

Making small rearrangements of daily schedule can often create pockets of time
for extra reading. As an example while in London using the underground:
starting the commute from a different station added 5 minutes to the journey
but eliminated one train exchange. This created a 25 minute continuous commute
back and forth, totalling to almost an hour for reading each working day.

## It is OK to quit or stop

This hack is again from a person from the IT start-up scene whom I cannot
remember: If at any given point while reading you feel like doing something
else, then stop. Do what you have to and then come back or leave it for another
day.

I would extend this suggesting that it is OK to stop reading books if they end
up not interesting or if the mood about them changes. This happened with the
third part of the Dune series: I wanted to read more about the sands of the
planet Arrakis, but after following up from volume two I just could not follow
through. I dropped the book immediately and will probably pick it up at some
point in the future. A close friend always reads books up to their last page no
matter what.  After trying to do the same, I found myself not wanting to read
anything significant for a couple of weeks.

The above should not become a habit of starting something and never finishing.
The tactic should exist as a tool, but one of the tools that are not used
often.

## Prefer paperbacks

Paperbacks have some advantages: They are easier to carry around because of
weight and size. This means it is easier to utilise opportunities to read,
hence one can read more. Because of the lower price, there is less guilt in
“book abuse”: underlining, sticking post-its, having coffee spill over in a
coffee shop etc.

There is another factor that contributes to reading paperbacks: they can be
purchased from alternative sources. Remember the 3rd book of the Dune series
mentioned before? It was purchased from a Christian charity from the US for
about £2.50 which is the cost of one cup of coffee in a UK café. This means
that there is both the contribution to the charity as well as that stop reading
it was associated with a £2.50 “loss”, which would be easier than doing the
same to a £30 hard-copy.

### But I hate paperbacks and I love my kindle

... and that's OK. What this section wants to convey is more something in the
lines of *"Choose your preferred medium"*. Whichever works best.

## Alternate between "fact" and "fiction" titles

Maybe the most “personal” one, in the area that it might not be applicable to
everyone. Alternating between fiction and non fiction titles helps to: enjoy
reading more leading to generally reading more, introduce new concepts,
cultivate my English.

## Buy now to read later

Alternatively bookmark when on-line, write down the title in a notepad,
generally archive details. Buy now/read later applies more for items that are
either rare or in sale or for any reason attractive to purchase. You see
the volume that you want to read a bench selling for £2: Can be purchased on
the spot and be read in a year.

Alternatively archiving/bookmarking so that the information can be referenced
back. One "app for that" is Google's
[Keep](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep)
which can store both photos and text in post-it format.

## Accept and Admit it

Placed it as the last one to demonstrate that the above hacks are of different
importance to each one. For some this could be the first step.

Admit first to yourself that reading is one of the ways to educate and inform
yourself. Then that this is not everyone's choice and that's OK. There are
people that learn through different media or are just reading-intolerant. There
are also people that want to evolve and people that feel fine as they are.

I could have not stated it better than Malkhaz Geldiashvili who inspired me to
write this post, quoting his YouTube video transcript:

*"So the two issues that I come across with this: The first one is, I always have
one person tell me, '**That's too much**. Why are you straining yourself, dude? Like that's
way too much.' And they say something like, 'I read a couple of books every year, and
I'm fine with that.' And that's OK. I'm not going to criticize that, but that's what
I do when I play tennis for example. So I play tennis a couple of times a month, but
I would never go up to a professional tennis player, who's passionate about what he does,
and tell him, 'Dude, why are you straining yourself? You know, just relax. You don't
have to practice that much.' You know, it's the exact same thing. And reading is something
that I'm most passionate about because, it has really transformed my life. With every
book that I read, I become happier, I become financially stronger, physically stronger,
emotionally stronger. And the second issue that I come across with sometimes is this
whole thing of, I call it '**pseudo-aristocrat problem**.' Basically a person that read a bunch
of Mark Twain back in the day or whatever, and he tells you, 'You know, if you don't
read a book, then it doesn't count.' And I have done both. I've read many books and I've
listened to many books, and I can tell you there is pretty much no real difference in
doing either one. And you have **nothing to be ashamed of**."*
