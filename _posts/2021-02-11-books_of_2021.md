# Books of 2021

## A Short History of England - Simon Jenkins

Plus: Very condensed, will help me understand books that I will read later on English history. Gives perspective.

Minus: Loves Parliament as an institution too much. Has this approach on writing English history that for the imperial years mentions only on what was happening only in England leaving gaps, example: discusses that in the 1950s troops needed to suppress two uprisings, in I think Kenya and Cyprus, but nowhere mentions how and why say Cyprus became part of the empire in the first place.
