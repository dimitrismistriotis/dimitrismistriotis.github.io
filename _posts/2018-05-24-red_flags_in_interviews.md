# Red Flags in Interviews

## Introduction

This is a transcribe with some modifications of the discussion we had for the
podcast [FetaReport](www.fetareport.gr). With the original content
in Greek, we thought that it might be good to release our content for an
international audience. If you think that such content would be of interest to
you even if spoken with funny accents, please reach out to us or leave a
comment here so that we will be able to react to your feedback and start
recording in English.

It is important to note that there is no perfect job, that a red flag for one
green for another and that also what one wants from a job depends on
personality, lifestyle, stages in life (e.g.: single, married, family) or in
one word: circumstance. With that in mind a "we work all day long"
signal might be a red flag for a family man but a "wow I will learn a lot"
for a young single person who wants to acquire experience.

Hope this article will help make you feel a little bit more prepared for your
next job hunt or at least entertain you.

This is a transcribe with some modifications of the discussion we had for the
podcast [FetaReport](www.fetareport.gr). Unfortunately the original content is
in Greek. We thought that it might be good to release our content for an

Recently two members of the crew had gone out to look for positions, while the
other member had been in the same situation very recently. Reading the job
descriptions and taking the corresponding phone calls (initial or later stage)
we saw some patterns emerging which at some point started documenting for
broadcasting them in a podcast episode, which got released at the end of
May 2018.

Before we start it is important to note that there is no perfect job, that a
red flag for one person might be a green flag for another and that also what we
want from a job depends on our personality, lifestyle, stages in life
(e.g.: single, married, family) or in one word, our circumstances. With that in
mind a "we work all day long" signal might be a red flag for a family man but
a "wow I will learn a lot" for a young single person who wants to acquire
experience.

Hope this article will help make you feel a little bit more prepared for your
job hunt.

## People

One of us is a Software Engineer, one does Digital Marketing and the third
member is in the Design industry.

## Lots of Work Up Front

First red flag: when a company asks you in the early stages of the interview
process to do lots of work **just** so you proceed through the application
process.

In Digital Marketing there are companies that ask the interviewer to implement
small tasks that might take 0.5 to 1 hour max.

While on the design industry we encountered briefs so vague that could easily
take whole teams to implement them, similarly on the IT field we were asked
to make whole applications from scratch.

Usually recruiters tend to be passive aggressive about it saying that
"you look great and a good fit" for our company followed by the infamous "but",
"... make this thing first, it will not take more than 10 hours," as if someone
can manifest 10 hours out of thin air.

Discussing this with people in the design field, it has been brought up as a
"scourge" of the industry. An insider has anonymously disclosed that with the
main aim of companies doing this is not so much to check how a good fit
the candidate is, but rather to check if this person is willing to give them
10 hours or a weekend of his life just to be interviewed by the company.
Another aim could be not so much to test the candidate but rather to block
them from applying to other companies in parallel.

On the IT field there is some history. Many years ago there was a research
done among a number of many university graduates in India. It was found that
a large percentage of those graduates (around 40%)could not implement
a small FizzBuzz algorithm in any programming language.

Reference, see this for a FizBuzz video:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">we wrote fizzbuzz on a PDP-11 at Seattle&#39;s living computer museum!! <a href="https://t.co/RI1QluFNef">pic.twitter.com/RI1QluFNef</a></p>&mdash; üîéJulia Evansüîç (@b0rk) <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/998972366410735617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">22 May 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As an antidote to this, these tests were invented and many companies that offer
"testing as a service", whose purpose was to filter out that 40% of the
candidates (see also: [Why Can't Programmers.. Program?](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/)).

An extension of this was for small tasks to see if people *culturally* fit
within their future team. For example say that there is something
vague in the specification, will the candidate ask for clarification? Do what
they think is best and move on? Both? Or will they do nothing since they are
not certain? All of the above are proper responses and would be unacceptable or
not in different teams and cultures. Some companies also invite you to work on
their premises for a day to validate you and see your approach. A degraded
version of this is that 10 hour "test".

Apart from the generic test, that remains the same for everybody every year,
companies might also adjust their "creative tests" to problems they are
actively facing. This is a good way for them to get cheap (i.e free) insights
to problems they are currently dealing with. In the form of an "interview
test". This has the added bonus that they will not have to pay for the
solution or insights provided by the candidate. Typical win-lose scenario.

It is quite common for people in these industries, especially after some years,
to have a portfolio or a repository of sorts that shows their work. However
this level of past work is constantly ignored and candidates are still asked
to perform time intensive tasks and tests for companies.

## Fast Paced Environment

Usually mentioned as "fast paced environment" within the job description. Some
alternatives are that *"we move very fast"*, or we "work hard, **play** hard" -
though rarely or never accompanied from "we **pay** hard".

Recently some of us have encountered a statement read from the person on the
other side of the phone  in the lines of "... our people stay longer hours
**every** day not because someone forces them but because they (really)
want to...". We all stay longer hours in the office from time to time, to
finish tasks or for personal reasons, even personal development. The red flag
here exists when the company mentions that (1) everyone (2) all the time, stays
late. (3) Perpetually.

This can be an attempt to mask problematic project management or the
absence of management altogether. One of us was told that some days he had to
stay longer because some clients were located overseas in the US so had to make
late evening phone calls with them. He ended up having his working hours
changed starting working from 08:00 in the morning instead of the contracted
09:00 on top of leaving later. That time was mostly spend waiting for other
teams to deliver workloads because of bad or no coordination between teams.
Nobody wanted to jump in and reform or restructure things.

When this was brought up, management claimed that "we informed you in the
interview that sometimes you might have to stay late". So by using this
"arbitrary clause", the system was abused and the need to "stay late" was
used as a crutch to cover for other more obvious communication and management
problems.

## Leader of Team of One‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäResponsible for Everything

Some roles advertise for lead positions then early on on the first steps of
the discussion, even in the initial call, it is made clear that
the person will be "*leading*" a team of one consisting only of themselves.
"Leader" in this context means that one will be responsible for all the
functions of a team.

In one case a company was advertising for a UX designer but also wanted
the same person to do their advertisement campaign banners blending two
functions as one position because... creative. The rationale was that the
company was entering the space now, with what the UX person was supposed to do
was not fully comprehended by them nor they had incorporated this function to
their structure and workflows. Hence the UI/UX person would be responsible for
doing the "old" thing while the company would be maturing.

Another way was to say that the company is currently expanding so that because
candidate will be there early on, first, later on they will "*build a team
around them*". This can be treated as way to bait for someone senior:
"we want a person to be responsible for everything" is a hard pill to swallow,
while be responsible for everything while in the background we are building a
team around you sounds like a fair deal. In the meantime you will hold the
title of "head of development" as titles come off cheap.

From past experiences, one of us got hired and found that he was
the most senior on his team. Later on when the company grew, he got promoted to
a manager and a team was structured around him. This was not discussed and
of course not promised in the interview, it happened organically as the team
and company expanded. The position was not advertised as managerial hence it
was a nice career move, if the same person was being interviewed for a
managerial position, he would like to meet the team or influence team's hiring
decisions.

Another member had a different experience: he got hired somewhere with the
promise of having a team  to be built around him. Tried his best as
developer/architect but when the time came to expand he saw that a project got
outsourced instead of having someone to report under him. When later on people
came on board they reported directly to the CTO not him as they were supposedly
serving a different function. At some point he was told that management had
found a great developer, something rare in their minds, one they did not want
to lose trading him for a manager with an unproven track record, at least
within the specific company.

While the above argument might make sense for the company, id definitely did
not for the person in question: the person had not taken other positions
in other organizations that were more straightforward with him like advertising
a position with strictly technical responsibilities. Then he worked hard not
being compensated because at the end of the day there would be a managerial
promotion.

## Puzzle Mania

Puzzles relate to the IT field more than anything. In several interview
scenarios where candidates are asked to solve one puzzle after another.

There are algorithmic puzzles such as shortest paths, double linked lists.
Generally topics taught in Academia some times as part of how operating systems
work or on programming language compilation and execution. The problem with
these sort of puzzles is that they act greatly in favor to recent graduates.
Sometimes subconsciously, sometimes with intent.

This intent was evident when a company was accused of age discrimination.
Their response was "everyone can join, we have an impartial interview process".
Although that was correct in theory and the job description was not limited to
a specific age range. The questions asked involved exercises and puzzles that
were more relatable (i.e "fresh") to a graduate's mind. A clever, and subtle,
way to separate candidates by age, since recent graduates will be more capable
in solving these puzzles.

UK law does not allow you to select candidates based on gender, race, age, etc.
This is one of the main reasons why sharing personal information such as sex,
race or even a photo through our CV is frowned upon. With that in mind if you
want to hire only young graduates for a specific reason, you can do so by
asking mainly about puzzles. Of course that also applies to "older" graduates;
after an MSc at the ripe age of 29 one of us was able to ace all these tests.
But when that same person had some years away from academia, they struggled in
answering those questions simply because the specifics of those algorithms had
wean off their memory.

Update (post publish): This behavior can be attributed to other ways apart from
filtering out candidates, even if this is the end result. It can be attributed
to a bad choice of interviewer. It can be that a developer has been asked to
aid with hiring, then knowing not much about the interview process just
searches online and uses the first results that come up for "clever programming
interviews questions". Another reason could be that big companies adopt these
puzzles with a "trend" and herd mentality; "if Google does it so should we".

## Do That Now - One Hour

This is the mental offspring of "Puzzle Mania" with the "Work up Front",
where you end up doing some online tests that you have to finish in one hour
no matter what.

Problems with this approach have to do with how different people react to
strict deadlines. One of us due to previous past experiences has knee-jerk
reactions like asking the rationale of assigning an hour before starting the
task. Also how many day to day tasks in real life need to finish within exactly
an hour? What happens if one gets finished in half?

In some of these on-line configurations tasks can be easily finished in about
20 to 30 minutes and the rest can be used for assurance, fixing an occasional
issue or for buffer. In some other cases it is configured closer to one hour of
coding non-stop favoring those who have solved a very similar exercise or
puzzle in the past.

Some companies treat it as a stress test to validate how people function under
tight constraints. There is always as before the possibility of following the
herd: if everybody else does these tests we should also integrate them in our
interviewing process.

That is not to say that these tests are absolute however. Good companies gauze
the quality of work you did within that hour. Your rationale, approach and
problem solving is interesting to them even if you do not manage to solve
the problem. There are however companies that either have a very rigid or very
unpolished hiring approach: for those companies, solving the problem is
top priority, no matter the approach. If you miss the mark, even by a few
minutes, you fail.

## You Will Learn the Domain

It is suggested on and off that by working in a company, one will "*learn the
domain*". For example while working for a bank one will learn the ins and outs
of how financial markets operate, similarly how the betting industry works when
building betting software, etc.

This is generally a good idea and something, if anything, expected to happen.
It becomes problematic when it is used as a cover for the absence of
procedures, proper project management, or infrastructure from the company‚Äôs
end.

One possible reason is if the company does not have anything substantial to
offer in this area. As an example say that a company operates in the health
sector so an employee is supposed to interact a lot with doctors. In this case
they will learn how the medical space works by interacting with practitioners
on a daily basis. It can mean, and we have lots of prior experience of this,
that there is no project management, people responsible for Quality Assurance,
other roles, so the individual does a mix of requirements gathering, customer
support, customer service, and project management... on top of their typical
duties.

A good way to summarize it is that in these places you do not get out of your
comfort zone and expand your skills, you rather do things that are not related
to your profession at all. Companies do not level you up from your current
level as a professional, more like one step "out". All this has been
historically served as "get to know the domain".

## Skills do not Matter

In this scenario evaluation of the candidate's skills, their current and future
trajectory takes a back seat. The "Skills do not matter" approach has more to
do with the candidate's personality, norms, attributes, hobbies and how they
align with the ones of the team they are about to join.

In other words, checking if the interviewee is a good "lad/lassie",
not a potentially good employee.

One of us got interviewed for a firm that was building an application for dog
owners. The offices were crowded with doggos, pupper posters and other floof
related paraphernalia. The interview was going well until the point where the
director asked "do you like dogs?". The candidate, not really ever owning a
dog, replied with "they are OK I guess". He could immediately see the scorn in
he directors eyes, the interview was cut short with a promise of a
"*future followup*" that never happened.

## No Career Progression

Came across this while talking with companies from a hiring platform: There
are companies that had a very good event like won a big contract or got to
a next funding round. This is generally great news and congratulations on
their teams for achieving this.

On this stage of their journey they want a number of people to help their
offering take off or participate in getting them to their next stage such as
contribute to help them scale up.

While talking to them there seemed that there was no clue on what would happen
to a potential employee after this stage. How would a person once joining their
ranks evolve after the "blood sweat and tears" period. For all one knows after
their offering becomes mature they might even downsize so the person who gave
all that hard work would go away.

These positions are good for someone who starts their career and there will
get exposed to many different experiences or for someone who wants this
know-how in order to do their own company. But generally the offering is
asymmetric since the the employer wants the employee to do the "extra" but
there is no compensation for it at the end.

## Projects / Departments Build Around Rick

Another red flag  is "projects build around Rick".
Rick is an alias based on "[We fired our top talent. Best decision we ever made](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-fired-our-top-talent-best-decision-we-ever-made-4c0a99728fde)"
and the response: "[You fired your top talent. I hope you‚Äôre happy](https://startupsventurecapital.com/you-fired-your-top-talent-i-hope-youre-happy-cf57c41183dd)".
It describes projects or sometimes whole departments structured around a single
person, named Rick for the sake of argument.

One problem with these setups is that when Rick leaves for any reason, even
when ill for a couple of days, everything kind of collapses at worst or becomes
crippled and cannot function. When Rick is on holiday, or out of the office for
any reason, he still answers to emails or participates in chat rooms.

If Rick prefers a specific methodology then everybody has to use that
methodology, the same applies to design approach, programming language,
everything. Other employees have to listen to the Prima Donna.

One reason for this to happen is that at some point back in time Rick built
something that somehow worked, or was the only one remaining in the same
company from the members that did so. From that moment in time everything
everything has been cast in stone with Rick being the guardian of that
tradition.

This shows up in interviews where questions that are usually open ended are
tailored to see if you answer exactly what that person would like to hear.
Some other times it is brought up exactly as it is: "we use an in-house
platform that our lead developer has built". Independent on if that person has
done things right, wrong or anything, this is how thing should work and he
should be in full control. They found that poor or many times not so poor
soul and all the projects are on his shoulders.

Another way to spot this is places by meeting people in different
interview stages all of which have stayed in "Rick's" department for 1 or 2
years maximum. For a "magic" reason after that they tend to disappear. Reason
is easy to guess: they either wanted to evolve  or they did not work as Rick's
satellites.

## Be a Company's Rick

A variation of the Rick situation above is when a company wants to hire you
so that you will become their Rick: just get all their current and future
projects, work 48 hours per day and let everyone depend on you.

## Sink or Swim

It refers to when you start working having to figure out everything by
Usually there are catch phrases like: *"commit production code on the first
days"*, *"impact on the first days"*, *"hit the ground running"* on interview
or on the job description. Discussing for when there is no on-boarding or
explaining how infrastructure works.

We are not advocating hand-holding the new employee but rather start from
simple stuff and move on to more serious stuff that a person cannot deduce on
their own. Something technical like: "we use Jira to manage tickets", or when
to call out a client, when do you call out, does a specific person need to
reach out first? Is it OK to interrupt people when they talk to ask questions
in a meeting?

There was a place without any on-boarding at all with management was
complaining when things were going wrong on top. Once a client asked something
in an email to which the there was an immediate response from the marketing
person. Then that marketing person was was told from their manager that they
should have asked them before reaching out. There was lots of guesswork on
whom to ask, when to ask, when not to ask, what is OK, what is not OK;
Questions not related with the specifics of the job or the profession but how
to function within the specific organization.

Facebook does that but the new employee is on their first days being guided by
a person who is already there guiding their steps. Then gradually that person
acting as "training wheels" moves progressively more and more to the background
as the new employee integrates with the organization. In other places that the
same thing happens they assign something really trivial like "change the
background color of that button". By doing a series of trivial tasks or some
times janitorial tasks or even cleaning up the back log, one gets their head
around the systems, learns how to set up a development environment, and so
forth.

When asking in different places about why this happens the "official" answer
was usually that there were not enough resources or in a more fake-polite
English way that proper on-boarding is a "luxury". In reality it is more a
"smell" of bad management: people that became managers just by waiting their
turn as other more proper managers were leaving or cases where the only
developer (the one who actually got to "build a team around them") got promoted
as the company expanded, which is a good thing, but without any training or
learning on the new position. One of those functional idiots gave the
semi-autistic response: "*I did not have any on-boarding so neither should
you*", ignoring that different people have different needs or that he was there
when there were very few people and minuscule infrastructure so things were
very easy to guess while on-boarding for him happened but not formally.

---

This refers to when you finish the interview and then they drop you in the
middle of the place with you having to figure out everything by yourself. Not
having on-boarding or telling you how the infrastructure works. We are not
talking about hand-holding the new employee in a way that you would expect a
junior to function but start from simple stuff such as - joking - "this is the
bathroom", "here we have coffee, milk, and sugar". More seriously items that
a person cannot deduce on their own like: we use tickets which we manage with
Jira if a technical example is allowed. When to call out a client. When do you
call out, does someone else need to talk first? Is it OK to interrupt people
when they talk to ask questions in a meeting?

As an example the marketing person of the team worked for a place where there
was no on-boarding at all and on top of this management was complaining
if/when you were doing something wrong. Once a client asked something in an
email to which the there was an immediate response. Then the marketing person
was was told from their manager that they should have asked him before
reaching out. There was lots of guesswork on whom to ask, when to ask,
when not to ask, what is OK, what is not OK? Not how to do your job, but
how to function within the specific organization.

The developer of the team had seen signs which he ignored or added some
wishful thinking, catch phrases like: *"commit production code on the first
days"*, *"you will have impact on the first days"*, UK companies say that some
times as *"hit the ground running"*. Facebook does that but the new employee
is on their first days being guided by a person who is already there guiding
their steps. Then gradually that person acting as "training wheels" moves more
and more to the background as you get integrated in the organization. In other
places that the same thing happens they assign something really silly like
"change the background color of that button" so that you will get your head
around their systems, set up a development environment, and so forth.

A counter example was a company whose on-boarding was next to fantastic: On the
first month you were shadowing Seniors, or working under their supervision
without having immediate responsibilities.

When usually a question is raised about this, like "I a new here where is my
on-boarding" there is usually the answer that the company is still small, does
not have the resources of a big company which can allow people to do this. Have
also heard English words that imply a lot such as on-boarding being a "luxury",
or more straightforward in the lines of "we are a startup and do not have
time for this".

The consensus of the discussion was that there is a problem with management
when this happens: we have people that became managers either because they had
stuck with the company for ten years and the other managers left, retired, or
died or alternatively they were the only developer (the one that they would
build a team around) who got promoted as the company grows - which is a good
thing - but without any training or learning for the new position, so they
do not know what to do wearing their new shoes. Asking one of them there was
a semi-autistic response "I did not have any on-boarding so neither should
you", with the person saying this ignoring that different people have different
needs or that he was there when the organization had a few people so
on-boarding happened but in an ad-hoc informal fashion. Similarly when that
person joined the company had a smaller scope of operations and established
procedures or ways to do things.

Jason: Something else is when you finish with the interview get hired and they
just throw you in the middle of the place with you having to figure out
everything.

Socrates: Love it.

Jason: Not even how the infrastructure works, go figure it out, no on-boarding.

Socrates: Specially if you are not hired as Senior, or principal, or the
adjective that is now in fashion.

Jason: Ninja
PICTURE OF A NINJA HERE

Socrates: Unicorn! Unicorn designer. The absolute perfection. If you are lead
of the planet, say OK. But even as a junior.

Jason: Not necessarily, even the basics: where is the coffee and where is the
sugar.

Socrates: Yes, I assume that you need to be introduced to to culture of the
company.

Jason: Where are the bathrooms. :).

Socrates: Stuff like how they manage tickets at Jira (too technical).

Jason: When to call out a client. When do you call out, does someone else need
to talk first? Is it OK to interrupt people when they talk to ask questions?

Socrates: Is it out of experience?

Jason: Yes.

Socrates: Give us an example.

Jason: In the previous place there was no on-boarding at all and on top of this
they were complaining if/when you were doing something wrong. Once a client
asked me something in an email and I answered immediately. I was told from my
manager that I should have asked him before reaching out. I would have to be
involved in guesswork on whom to ask, when to ask, when not to ask, what is OK,
what is not OK?

Socrates: Got it.

Jason: I think Dimitry had something like that recently.

Dimitry: I did, I am still not completely detached, my heart now is beating
faster and I am ready to say something bad about the mother of the person I was
working with.

Jason: PTSD?

Dimitry: I am trying to relax so I cal talk, also had some coffee.

Jason: He has turned red, breathing heavily.

Socrates: See the vain ready to pop out.

Dimitry: I am ready to take a tube, go there, lease, since we had a discussion
about leasing, a Kalashnikov.

Socrates: It is Saturday, nobody is there.

Dimitry: I will wait until Monday behind the bell of the nearby Church.

Socrates: Share us your experience calmly then.

Dimitry: I cannot do so, so no. How do spot this though. You listen to catch
phrases like: "commit code on the first day", "you will have impact on the
first days"...

Socrates: You will hit the ground running!
Jason +
Dimitry: Yeah

Dimitry: "Commit production code in the first days". When I first encountered
this thought that all these things would happen with the assistance of a person
who was already there for some time guiding my steps. From point those
"training wheels" would be utilized less and less.

Jason: Not talking about how to do your job, but how to function within that
organization.

Dimitry: Where this thing happened to me, I lost an afternoon because some
tests were not working. I fixed them. Once I fixed them I found out that they
were not used at all anywhere. Went to my manager and told him that one
afternoon got wasted, you might want to know about the deadline. Should not you
be on top of me before I did so? "No" (his answer). We will inform you dear
audience about the end of that story in a later transmission/podcast.
The other thing that happens on our field is that you will write production
code from the first day, Facebook was doing this at some point, but
"production" can be something so trivial as changing the color of a button.

Socrates: Something very small.

Dimitry: So that you will start interacting with the system from the first day.
This is OK

Jason: Let me bring another example. This was my first UK job, which had some
issues but their on-boarding was at least fantastic: On the first month you
were shadowing Seniors, or working under their supervision without having
immediate responsibilities.

Socrates: Generally my on-boarding experiences were amazing with the exception
of a single start-up. Do you believe that these things happen more in startups
and less in established companies which have some capital and resources, so in
the first months that you are learning things, there is no negative impact?

Jason: I think that in very big companies there would be an HR department which
would have implemented procedures, in SMEs...

Socrates: I am talking below mid.

Jason: I do not think it has to do with size, in many companies people have
become managers with no previous experience or training in management only
because they have been employed for the last say 10 years.

Dimitry: Or two years, but they happened to be there when the company started.

## What Would You Do?

We decided to do a follow up Podcast on the subject but do not know when.
Sent us your opinions, procedures, and generally "how you it", or stuff that
you liked while being interviewed.

A [listener](https://www.reddit.com/r/greece/comments/8n7lht/Œ∫œåŒ∫Œ∫ŒπŒΩŒµœÇ_œÉŒ∑ŒºŒ±ŒØŒµœÇ_œÉŒµ_œÉœÖŒΩŒµŒΩœÑŒµœçŒæŒµŒπœÇ_œÑŒπ_ŒΩŒ±_œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ≠œáŒµœÑŒµ/dztto53) came with his approach which we loosely translated:

> One way that I prefer is to give them a small problem,
