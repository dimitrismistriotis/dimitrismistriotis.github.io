# Red Flags in Interviews

This is a transcribe with some modifications of the discussion we had for the
podcast [FetaReport](www.fetareport.gr). Unfortunately the original content is
in Greek so unless you are on of those Mediterraneans it will not be of much
use. We thought that it might be good to release our content for an
international audience. Before I start on a side note, the podcast is about
people of our generation who have moved abroad and as first-generation
immigrants have to adjust to their new country which for the three of us is UK.
If you think that such content would be of interest to you even if spoken with
funny accents, please reach out to us or leave a comment here so that we will
be able to react to your feedback and start releasing stuff in English.

## Introduction

Recently two members of the crew, Socrates and Dimitry had gone out to look for
positions, while the other member Jason had been in the same situation some
months before. Reading  the job descriptions and taking the corresponding phone
calls (initial or later stage) we saw some patterns emerging which at some
point started documenting for the podcast.

Before we start it is important to note that there is no perfect job, that a
red flag for one person might be a green flag for another and that also what
we want from a job depends on our personality, lifestyle, stages in life (e.g.:
single, married, family) or in one word, our "situation". With that in mind a
"we work all day long" signal might be a red flag for a family man but a
"wow I will learn a lot" for a young single person who wants to acquire
experience.

With the above in mind lets start.


## People

Socrates: Works in design, UI/UX.
Jason: Digital Marketing.
Dimitry (me): IT, Software Engineer.

## Lots of work up front

Socrates: The first read flag I have encountered were those cases where the
potential employer was asking for so much work **before** getting into the
late stages of the interview. Stuff like: "yeah, you look so great, we
definitely want to interview you, but we would like you to build an app if
possible from scratch", this is followed by: "it should not take more than
10 hours" as if I can magically create 10 hours out of thin air.
Jason: In the marketing section I have encountered this by people asking me to
perform small tasks which never take more than two or three hours. For both
of you people ask you a lot.
Socrates: By talking to someone who is very experienced in the field, they
identified it as a plague of the industry. For this person the aim is not so
much to see if you are capable of working in that capacity, they usually want
to see if you are willing to give ten hours in order to work there.
Dimitry: From an IT angle, because I am a bit middle aged. Many years before
there was a study on the graduates of a specific Indian university where
a big amount of people could not even write a small program. I had tried with
a student of mine to see if they could write a program implementing the so
called FIZZ-BUZZ algorithm (LINKS HERE). So these tests were put in place
initially to filter out those people that could not function at all.
Jason: What you suggest though is a 20-30 minute task, Socrates talked about
10s of hours per company.
Dimitry: This is where the whole thing went south like a lot. Initially it
was a good way to filter out people that were not there yet. There are many
companies that offer this as a service. You give 3-4 tasks like this for the
person to take them up front which covers for the case that they have
memorized a couple. When this thing started about 40% of people were instantly
rejected.
Jason: Again you are talking about an hour or so. Many companies give briefs
which would be potentially take a team months asking you to squeeze something
within 10 hours which easily become 40.
Socrates: I understand that you need to "work on" the job that you want to
end up to. On the other hand asking for creative work which might also be used
for something they need later on, even if you are not hired, goes way over the
top.
Jason: I can understand asking something small...
Socrates: This is why we have portfolios. Looking at a portfolio should be
enough to get the idea.
Dimitry: Without wanting to justify this behavior is say that we know or assume
that this person can perform say from the portfolio. Next question is: can this
person function on our team as it currently is? You give them a task and the
team that they want to interact with, leave some loose ends or some stuff
totally undefined. Say for example that what color to use somewhere as a
trivial example is not defined. Will Socrates make a decision on his own and
put something that fits, leave it colorless aiming to discuss later, or reach
out to someone else within the company. All of the above are valid approaches
but which one works best for the specific corporate or team culture?
Jason: Only huge companies are able to do this like get you there for a day
and experiment.
Socrates: Yes there are some companies that invite you for some hours or for
a day to see if you fit on their environment.
Dimitry: Exactly a degraded/decadent version of this is having to do a two day
task.
Socrates: You wish it was for two days.
Jason: I think this is unacceptable they take over your personal life. It is
like "us the big company are doing a favor to consider your application and
you need to prove that you are worthy" ...
Socrates: ... and also you have applied only to them and you have nothing else
going on with your life no other applications and not a job or anything.

Dimitry + Socrates + Jason: Let's go to the next one.

## Fast Paced Environment

Socrates: Something else that we recently encountered was the so called
"fast paced environment". We have very tight deadlines, we move very fast...
Jason: Work hard play hard.
Socrates: Exactly and also the thing that came up lots recently: "our people
stay longer hours, but it is why they want to, nobody forces them to do so".
Jason: I have also heard this it is very irritating.
Socrates: Which is by itself a big warning sign. Who wants to sit forever in
the office.
Dimitry: Some times I do not.
Jason: This is not something you normally say in the interview, Sometimes I
want to stay a bit longer, it is hot outside, I want to finish some small
things, for any reason.
Socrates: Yes, it is, or you want to do it. It is not forever nor everybody
wants to do it every single day.
Dimitry: There are many interpretations, what this means to me: I might stay
in the office a bit longer if there is say a technology I want to learn and it
is important to me and my career and I want to grab that knowledge. Second and
most important if this is being recognized financially in the bottom line and
generally. That last detail is something that is conveniently not mentioned
from those interviewers.
Socrates: The difference here is that Dimitry wants to do so for his agenda
and reasons, when it is "everybody" or "the majority", it does not ring a bell,
It is like the whole of Notre Damme.
