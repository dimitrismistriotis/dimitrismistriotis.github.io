# Red Flags in Interviews

## Introduction

This is a transcribe with some modifications of the discussion we had for the
podcast [FetaReport](www.fetareport.gr). Unfortunately the original content is
in Greek. We thought that it might be good to release our content for an
international audience. If you think that such content would be of interest to
you even if spoken with funny accents, please reach out to us or leave a
comment here so that we will be able to react to your feedback and start
releasing stuff in English.

Recently two members of the crew had gone out to look for positions, while the
other member had been in the same situation very recently. Reading the job
descriptions and taking the corresponding phone calls (initial or later stage)
we saw some patterns emerging which at some point started documenting for
broadcasting them in a podcast episode, which got released at the end of
May 2018.

Before we start it is important to note that there is no perfect job, that a
red flag for one person might be a green flag for another and that also what we
want from a job depends on our personality, lifestyle, stages in life
(e.g.: single, married, family) or in one word, our circumstances. With that in
mind a "we work all day long" signal might be a red flag for a family man but
a "wow I will learn a lot" for a young single person who wants to acquire
experience.

Hope this article will help make you feel a little bit more prepared for your
job hunt.

## People

One of us is a Software Engineer, one does Digital Marketing and the third
member is in the design industry.

## Lots of Work Up Front

First red flag: when a company asks you in the early stages of the interview
process to do lots of work **just** so you proceed through the application
process.

In Digital Marketing there are companies that ask the interviewer to implement
small tasks that might take 0.5 to 1 hour max.

While on the design industry we encountered briefs so vague that could easily
take whole teams to implement them, similarly on the IT field we were asked
to make whole applications from scratch.

Usually recruiters tend to be passive aggressive about it saying that
"you look great and a good fit" for our company followed by the infamous "but",
"... make this thing first, it will not take more than 10 hours," as if someone
can manifest 10 hours out of thin air.

Discussing this with people in the design field, it has been brought up as a
"scourge" of the industry. An insider has anonymously disclosed that with the
main aim of companies doing this is not so much to check how a good fit
the candidate is, but rather to check if this person is willing to give them
10 hours or a weekend of his life just to be interviewed by the company.
Another aim could be not so much to test the candidate but rather to block
them from applying to other companies in parallel.

On the IT field there is some history. Many years ago there was a research
done among a number of many university graduates in India. It was found that
a large percentage of those graduates (around 40%)could not implement
a small FizzBuzz algorithm in any programming language.

Reference, see this for a FizBuzz video:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">we wrote fizzbuzz on a PDP-11 at Seattle&#39;s living computer museum!! <a href="https://t.co/RI1QluFNef">pic.twitter.com/RI1QluFNef</a></p>&mdash; üîéJulia Evansüîç (@b0rk) <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/998972366410735617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">22 May 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As an antidote to this, these tests were invented and many companies that offer
"testing as a service", whose purpose was to filter out that 40% of the
candidates (see also: [Why Can't Programmers.. Program?](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/)).

An extension of this was for small tasks to see if people *culturally* fit
within their future team. For example say that there is something
vague in the specification, will the candidate ask for clarification? Do what
they think is best and move on? Both? Or will they do nothing since they are
not certain? All of the above are proper responses and would be unacceptable or
not in different teams and cultures. Some companies also invite you to work on
their premises for a day to validate you and see your approach. A degraded
version of this is that 10 hour "test".

Apart from the generic test, that remains the same for everybody every year,
companies might also adjust their "creative tests" to problems they are
actively facing. This is a good way for them to get cheap (i.e free) insights
to problems they are currently dealing with. In the form of an "interview
test". This has the added bonus that they will not have to pay for the
solution or insights provided by the candidate. Typical win-lose scenario.

It is quite common for people in these industries, especially after some years,
to have a portfolio or a repository of sorts that shows their work. However
this level of past work is constantly ignored and candidates are still asked
to perform time intensive tasks and tests for companies.

## Fast Paced Environment

Usually mentioned as "fast paced environment" within the job description. Some
alternatives are that *"we move very fast"*, or we "work hard, **play** hard" -
though rarely or never accompanied from "we **pay** hard".

Recently some of us have encountered a statement read from the person on the
other side of the phone  in the lines of "... our people stay longer hours
**every** day not because someone forces them but because they (really)
want to...". We all stay longer hours in the office from time to time, to
finish tasks or for personal reasons, even personal development. The red flag
here exists when the company mentions that (1) everyone (2) all the time, stays
late. (3) Perpetually.

This can be an attempt to mask problematic project management or the
absence of management altogether. One of us was told that some days he had to
stay longer because some clients were located overseas in the US so had to make
late evening phone calls with them. He ended up having his working hours
changed starting working from 08:00 in the morning instead of the contracted
09:00 on top of leaving later. That time was mostly spend waiting for other
teams to deliver workloads because of bad or no coordination between teams.
Nobody wanted to jump in and reform or restructure things.

When this was brought up, management claimed that "we informed you in the
interview that sometimes you might have to stay late". So by using this
"arbitrary clause", the system was abused and the need to "stay late" was
used as a crutch to cover for other more obvious communication and management
problems.

## Leader of Team of One‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäResponsible for Everything

Some roles advertise for lead positions then early on on the first steps of
the discussion, even in the initial call, it is made clear that
the person will be "*leading*" a team of one consisting only of themselves.
"Leader" in this context means that one will be responsible for all the
functions of a team.

In one case a company was advertising for a UX designer but also wanted
the same person to do their advertisement campaign banners blending two
functions as one position because... creative. The rationale was that the
company was entering the space now, with what the UX person was supposed to do
was not fully comprehended by them nor they had incorporated this function to
their structure and workflows. Hence the UI/UX person would be responsible for
doing the "old" thing while the company would be maturing.

Another way was to say that the company is currently expanding so that because
candidate will be there early on, first, later on they will "*build a team
around them*". This can be treated as way to bait for someone senior:
"we want a person to be responsible for everything" is a hard pill to swallow,
while be responsible for everything while in the background we are building a
team around you sounds like a fair deal. In the meantime you will hold the
title of "head of development" as titles come off cheap.

From past experiences, one of us got hired and found that he was
the most senior on his team. Later on when the company grew, he got promoted to
a manager and a team was structured around him. This was not discussed and
of course not promised in the interview, it happened organically as the team
and company expanded. The position was not advertised as managerial hence it
was a nice career move, if the same person was being interviewed for a
managerial position, he would like to meet the team or influence team's hiring
decisions.

Another member had a different experience: he got hired somewhere with the
promise of having a team  to be built around him. Tried his best as
developer/architect but when the time came to expand he saw that a project got
outsourced instead of having someone to report under him. When later on people
came on board they reported directly to the CTO not him as they were supposedly
serving a different function. At some point he was told that management had
found a great developer, something rare in their minds, one they did not want
to lose trading him for a manager with an unproven track record, at least
within the specific company.

While the above argument might make sense for the company, id definitely did
not for the person in question: the person had not taken other positions
in other organizations that were more straightforward with him like advertising
a position with strictly technical responsibilities. Then he worked hard not
being compensated because at the end of the day there would be a managerial
promotion.

---

There are some roles that advertise for lead positions and early on on the
first steps of the discussion even in the initial call it is made clear that it
is about "leading" a team of one. Lead in this context means that you will be
responsible for all the functions of a team in a small compact package.

In one case a company was advertising for a UX designer but they also wanted
someone to do their advertisement campaign banners and somehow blend these two
functions as one position. When asked the rationale was that the company was
entering the space now, and what the UX person was supposed to do was not fully
comprehended by them.

Another pattern was to say something in the lines of a company expanding so the
candidate will be there first and later on they would "build a team around
them". This can be treated as a bait for someone senior, you cannot say to
them "we want a person to be responsible for everything", so you say come here,
do everything and we will build later on a team around you, in the meantime you
will be "head of development" and that "within a year we will hire more
people".

Team discussed their personal experiences: One got hired and found that he was
the most senior on his team, later on he became a manager and a team was
structured around him. This was not discussed in the interview, it happened
organically as the team and company started growing. The position was not
advertised for a manager hence it was a nice career move, if the same person
was being interviewed for a managerial position, he would like to meet the
team.

Another member had a different experience: got hired somewhere where a team was
supposed to be built around him. Tried his best as developer but when the time
came to expand, one project got outsourced or other people started reporting to
the CTO, not him, there was no team being build around him. It seemed that
management had found a great developer in their minds, something rare for the
industry and they did not want to lose him for a manager without a track
record, at least within the company. There was discussion on if this would be
a good decision for the company or not since yes they had a good developer who
knew their systems how to "do things", etc. The counter argument was that it
might be something good or making sense for the company, but definitely not for
the person: the person had not taken other positions in other organizations
that were more straightforward to him ("we want a developer cannot promise
anything"), worked hard and not compensated because at the end of the day there
would be a promotion, and also had his career trajectory disrupted.

Having lived this experience the same person when in an interview call some
years later was told that a team would be build around him, asked if the
company would put this as a clause to his contract agreement. There he got
criticized from the other members that this approach displayed that he was not
interested in working there but rather on himself and what would happen to him.
A better approach was argued would be to ask for assurance later on closer to
the offer.

## Puzzle Mania

This is more for technological field more than any other and has to do with
interviews where the interviewee is asked to solve one puzzle after another.

There are algorithmic puzzles such as shortest paths, double linked lists,
stuff taught in University as part of how operating systems work and
programming languages compilation and execution.

The problem here is that these questions are biased towards people who have
just graduated. A way most of the time subconsciously to tilt towards
candidates that have just graduated. This was the response of a company
which was accused of age discrimination: "everyone can join, we have an
impartial interview process". Yes the interview does not do age checks, only it
asks questions that are easier to be answered by recent graduates hence young
people.

UK law does not allow you to prefer based on gender, race, age, etc. This is
one of the reason we do not put in this country our picture in the CV or
mention our sex or similar information in any way.

So in this case if you want to hire only graduates for any reason, you ask only
about this stuff. One of us did an MSc at the age of 29 and he was able to ace
all these tests. But on the other hand the same person after some years away
from academia, had problem answering those questions simply because the
internals of those algorithms had wean off in memory.

Update (this came from a listener, loosely translating): This behavior can be
attributed to other ways apart from filtering out candidates, even if this
happens at the end. It can be attributes to a bad choice of an interviewer. It
can be that a developer has been assigned to do hiring and knowing nothing
about it googles "clever questions for programming interviews". Another reason
has to do with big companies such as Google adopting it mixed with fashion and
herd mentality, "if they do it so should I".

## You Will Learn the Domain

It is common to suggest that by working in a company you will
*"learn the domain"*. Like if you work in a bank you will get to know how the
financial markets operate, or how the betting industry works, etc.

This is generally good and something if anything expected to happen. It becomes
problematic when it is used as a cover for the absence of procedures or
infrastructure from the company‚Äôs end. They do not have anything to offer to
you so the only thing they can come up with is domain knowledge. As an example
say that the company is in the health sector so you are supposed to interact a
lot with doctors. In this case you will learn how the medical space works by
interacting with practitioners on a daily basis. It can mean, and we have many
cases of this, that there is no project management, people responsible for QA,
other roles, so the developer does a mix of requirements gathering, customer
support, customer service, and project management... on top of the development
duties. It is also difficult to concentrate as the clients say doctors or
nurses might even have your phone number and contact you whenever they need
you. That is not related with marketing or client facing roles, where you need
to interact with them.

As a team member summarized it: you do not get out of your comfort zone and
expand your skills, you rather do things that are not related to your
profession at all. Companies do not push you one step "up" of where you are as
a professional, rather one step "out". All this is served as "get to know the
domain".

End of first part, second one coming soon.

Hope this article helped a bit and made you feel a little bit more prepared
for your job hunt.

the flow of the article let us know and we will do some episodes in English.

## Sink or Swim

This refers to when you finish the interview and then they drop you in the
middle of the place with you having to figure out everything by yourself. Not
having on-boarding or telling you how the infrastructure works. We are not
talking about hand-holding the new employee in a way that you would expect a
junior to function but start from simple stuff such as - joking - "this is the
bathroom", "here we have coffee, milk, and sugar". More seriously items that
a person cannot deduce on their own like: we use tickets which we manage with
Jira if a technical example is allowed. When to call out a client. When do you
call out, does someone else need to talk first? Is it OK to interrupt people
when they talk to ask questions in a meeting?

As an example the marketing person of the team worked for a place where there
was no on-boarding at all and on top of this management was complaining
if/when you were doing something wrong. Once a client asked something in an
email to which the there was an immediate response. Then the marketing person
was was told from their manager that they should have asked him before
reaching out. There was lots of guesswork on whom to ask, when to ask,
when not to ask, what is OK, what is not OK? Not how to do your job, but
how to function within the specific organization.

The developer of the team had seen signs which he ignored or added some
wishful thinking, catch phrases like: *"commit production code on the first
days"*, *"you will have impact on the first days"*, UK companies say that some
times as *"hit the ground running"*. Facebook does that but the new employee
is on their first days being guided by a person who is already there guiding
their steps. Then gradually that person acting as "training wheels" moves more
and more to the background as you get integrated in the organization. In other
places that the same thing happens they assign something really silly like
"change the background color of that button" so that you will get your head
around their systems, set up a development environment, and so forth.

A counter example was a company whose on-boarding was next to fantastic: On the
first month you were shadowing Seniors, or working under their supervision
without having immediate responsibilities.

When usually a question is raised about this, like "I a new here where is my
on-boarding" there is usually the answer that the company is still small, does
not have the resources of a big company which can allow people to do this. Have
also heard English words that imply a lot such as on-boarding being a "luxury",
or more straightforward in the lines of "we are a startup and do not have
time for this".

The consensus of the discussion was that there is a problem with management
when this happens: we have people that became managers either because they had
stuck with the company for ten years and the other managers left, retired, or
died or alternatively they were the only developer (the one that they would
build a team around) who got promoted as the company grows - which is a good
thing - but without any training or learning for the new position, so they
do not know what to do wearing their new shoes. Asking one of them there was
a semi-autistic response "I did not have any on-boarding so neither should
you", with the person saying this ignoring that different people have different
needs or that he was there when the organization had a few people so
on-boarding happened but in an ad-hoc informal fashion. Similarly when that
person joined the company had a smaller scope of operations and established
procedures or ways to do things.

Jason: Something else is when you finish with the interview get hired and they
just throw you in the middle of the place with you having to figure out
everything.

Socrates: Love it.

Jason: Not even how the infrastructure works, go figure it out, no on-boarding.

Socrates: Specially if you are not hired as Senior, or principal, or the
adjective that is now in fashion.

Jason: Ninja
PICTURE OF A NINJA HERE

Socrates: Unicorn! Unicorn designer. The absolute perfection. If you are lead
of the planet, say OK. But even as a junior.

Jason: Not necessarily, even the basics: where is the coffee and where is the
sugar.

Socrates: Yes, I assume that you need to be introduced to to culture of the
company.

Jason: Where are the bathrooms. :).

Socrates: Stuff like how they manage tickets at Jira (too technical).

Jason: When to call out a client. When do you call out, does someone else need
to talk first? Is it OK to interrupt people when they talk to ask questions?

Socrates: Is it out of experience?

Jason: Yes.

Socrates: Give us an example.

Jason: In the previous place there was no on-boarding at all and on top of this
they were complaining if/when you were doing something wrong. Once a client
asked me something in an email and I answered immediately. I was told from my
manager that I should have asked him before reaching out. I would have to be
involved in guesswork on whom to ask, when to ask, when not to ask, what is OK,
what is not OK?

Socrates: Got it.

Jason: I think Dimitry had something like that recently.

Dimitry: I did, I am still not completely detached, my heart now is beating
faster and I am ready to say something bad about the mother of the person I was
working with.

Jason: PTSD?

Dimitry: I am trying to relax so I cal talk, also had some coffee.

Jason: He has turned red, breathing heavily.

Socrates: See the vain ready to pop out.

Dimitry: I am ready to take a tube, go there, lease, since we had a discussion
about leasing, a Kalashnikov.

Socrates: It is Saturday, nobody is there.

Dimitry: I will wait until Monday behind the bell of the nearby Church.

Socrates: Share us your experience calmly then.

Dimitry: I cannot do so, so no. How do spot this though. You listen to catch
phrases like: "commit code on the first day", "you will have impact on the
first days"...

Socrates: You will hit the ground running!
Jason +
Dimitry: Yeah

Dimitry: "Commit production code in the first days". When I first encountered
this thought that all these things would happen with the assistance of a person
who was already there for some time guiding my steps. From point those
"training wheels" would be utilized less and less.

Jason: Not talking about how to do your job, but how to function within that
organization.

Dimitry: Where this thing happened to me, I lost an afternoon because some
tests were not working. I fixed them. Once I fixed them I found out that they
were not used at all anywhere. Went to my manager and told him that one
afternoon got wasted, you might want to know about the deadline. Should not you
be on top of me before I did so? "No" (his answer). We will inform you dear
audience about the end of that story in a later transmission/podcast.
The other thing that happens on our field is that you will write production
code from the first day, Facebook was doing this at some point, but
"production" can be something so trivial as changing the color of a button.

Socrates: Something very small.

Dimitry: So that you will start interacting with the system from the first day.
This is OK

Jason: Let me bring another example. This was my first UK job, which had some
issues but their on-boarding was at least fantastic: On the first month you
were shadowing Seniors, or working under their supervision without having
immediate responsibilities.

Socrates: Generally my on-boarding experiences were amazing with the exception
of a single start-up. Do you believe that these things happen more in startups
and less in established companies which have some capital and resources, so in
the first months that you are learning things, there is no negative impact?

Jason: I think that in very big companies there would be an HR department which
would have implemented procedures, in SMEs...

Socrates: I am talking below mid.

Jason: I do not think it has to do with size, in many companies people have
become managers with no previous experience or training in management only
because they have been employed for the last say 10 years.

Dimitry: Or two years, but they happened to be there when the company started.

## Projects Build around Rick

Another red flag for which we devised a name is "projects build around Rick".
Rick is an imaginary person we made up to describe the situation where projects
or sometimes whole departments are based or structured around a single person,
for the sake of argument named Rick.

One problem with these setups is that when Rick leaves for any reason, even
when ill for a couple of days, everything kind of collapses at worst or becomes
crippled and cannot function. On a day to day bases we have Rick who at a
specific point in time built something that somehow works or was there when
it was built by other members and is the only one left in the company,
everything he says is cast in stone. If Rick prefers a specific methodology
then everybody else has to use that methodology, the same applies to design
approach, programming language, everything. Other employees have to listen to
the Prima donna.

This shows up in interviews where questions that are usually open ended are
tailored to see if you answer what that person would like to hear. Usually that
person, Rick, is involved at some stage in the interview process and when
answering to one of the questions by HR or another person, asks something like:
"yes but if we did this" with the rest of the room immediately
"wow"-ing on what they just heard, although again it was an open question.

Some other times it is discussed openly: "we use an in-house platform that our
lead developer has built". Independent on if that person has dome things right
or wrong or anything, this is how thing should work and he should have the
full control of everything. They found that poor or many times not so poor
soul and all the projects are on his shoulders.

Another way to spot this is places that have people, who we assume one meets
in different interview stages, who have stayed in "Rick's" department for 1 or
2 years and then they pop to 7, 8, etc. It seems that for a magic reason people
in that place disappear after a bit. The reason though is easy to guess: they
either wanted to try something new out or they did not want to spent their
professional life as satellites of that Rick.

Another variation of this is when a company wants to hire you so that you will
become that Rick: just get all their current and future projects, work 48 hours
per day and that's it for you.

Some articles popped up recently on the Internet taking two sides of this
argument. Both are a good and recommended read:

* https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-fired-our-top-talent-best-decision-we-ever-made-4c0a99728fde
* https://startupsventurecapital.com/you-fired-your-top-talent-i-hope-youre-happy-cf57c41183dd

---

Dimitry: Another one which I did not know how to name, is when "projects
have been build around Rick".

Jason: We read some related articles in Medium and we will provide some links.
The article speaks about places that have hired someone senior or someone with
lots of experience and then force everybody else or even the whole company to
gravitate around these people. Projects and the whole company become so
dependent on them that once they leave.

* https://startupsventurecapital.com/you-fired-your-top-talent-i-hope-youre-happy-cf57c41183dd


Socrates: And when they leave...

Jason: Chaos comes in.

Jason: I have seen people crippling the whole company.

Dimitry: So the magic Jonathan Ive comes in and has build something that
somehow works, and then it is cast in stone. If they prefer a specific
methodology than everybody else has to follow suite even if they are not happy
with this particular methodology. Even if everybody else disagrees we have to
listen to the prima-donna.
This shows up in interviews where the questions are tailored to see if you
answer what that person would like to hear.

Jason: In the previous place I was, our lead developer was involved in ALL
our projects - with ownership and setting up processes. He was a little
difficult as person to interact with. His ways were too complicated and hard
to understand. There was a project that dragged for 8 months while it could
have been done in three because "Rick" - that person - was saying that he
had to rewrite this, or that we needed to build this thing from scratch and so
on, moving back and forth.

Dimitry: The question is how this is can be discovered on the interview.
Sometimes Rick will be involved in the interview process and ask questions that
do not have a right or wrong answer, when you answer something that contradicts
his ways, he will say something like: "yes but if we did this" and immediately
the whole room will "wow" on what they just heard, although again it was an
open question.

Socrates: Sometimes they say it to you: we use an in-house platform that our
lead developer has built. Independent on if that person has dome things right
or wrong or anything, this is how thing should work and he should have the
full control of everything. They found that poor or many times not so poor
soul and all the projects are on his shoulders.

Dimitry: This where we have a potentially "sick"/"problematic"/"dysfunctional"
relationship between Rick and that company. Company has allowed Rick to do
whatever he wants, Rick is doing so, at the expense of existing or new
employees.

Jason: Not when the company already has that "Rick" and there is that situation
which you might want to avoid. There is also the company that wants to hire
you so that you will become their Rick, with you ending up to work 48 hours
per day.

Dimitry: For me it is not about time or amount of work, but also the quality
of the relationship. You see going into places where there is a person who is
there for say 15 years, or 10 and everybody else is there for 2 years. The
mind goes instantly to the question: what happened and there are not any people
for 4 years, or 6? The answer is that people could not bear it any longer.

Socrates: Like working with legacy code?

Dimitry: Like spending their working hours as the satellite of that "Rick".

## Skills do not Matter

This one is based on experiences of some members and has to do not with
evaluating the skills of the candidate or their trajectory, but more on if
their personality norms are fitting the ones of the team on which they are
about to join. One of us got interviewed for a firm that was building products
for dog owners with a big part of the interview being his relationship with
man's best friend.

---

Jason: Another red flag which I have encountered and want your opinion is when
you go to interviews and they say to you that they do not hire based on skills
but based on what type of person you are, your character.

Socrates: Is this bad?

Jason: Invalidating everything you can do? Or the contrary: we only care about
your skill-set not about your personality.

Dimitry: It has happened to me from a company that I will not name. There was
a place where they had an intermediary CTO who liked to hire people based on
character. My final interview happened to be when his contract had finished, he
had handled over to the next CTO who was only interested in skills. These two
people have different approaches. I went to the last interview with an agenda
that HR had sent me with questions all about character. When I got there the
new CTO started asking me about previous experience and skills. At some point
I stopped him and said something in the lines of "hey buddy, your HR gave me
this agenda and you are not touching it, what is going on?". At that point I
realized there would not be a match.

Socrates: Sometimes character checks are to identify if you will be part of
our clique. I am not talking about gentrification or Uber style recruitment,
mentioning it after things in the news about them hiring only people that
there were just like them.

Dimitry: I will tell a story that I got from a friend named George, I do not
have his permission, so will use only first name. George happened to meet a
multi-billionaire, at that time in his life, George had a problem hiring people
in the company that he was working for. That company had a skills matrix
approach. He had a matrix of skills, these were rare in that region so most
candidates scored really low.

Socrates: What is that matrix?

Dimitry: You create a matrix of what you want. Say I want a person to be a good
designer, average communicator, this good-to-have, this at OK levels, etc.
This goes in the "columns" of that matrix. The candidates go to the rows where
you see who "ticks" and who "X-es". It is like the feature comparison we see
in product offerings. So you get that Socrates has 20% match, Jason 25%, and
Dimitry 10%. The person higher is the most preferred candidate. But because
this is the way you see the world, mapping people to skills, everybody can
potentially have a gap, like these people fit 80%. This is very useful for
companies that want to project people to a number so that they then will be
able to compare them in a way.
The multi-billionaire told him that this was wrong and that my friend should
hire based on character: if a person has a good attitude, they will "grow" to
fill the gaps in the skill-set, if the character of a person has flaws, even if
all the gaps are covered or all the boxes ticked when the position or the life
change then that person will not grow to fill that gap.

Jason: Yes but you need to cover some basics? If you say I will hire only based
on character you get into what we do in Greece: hire your best friend, your
second cousin.

Dimitry: This is not character.

Socrates: So start with skills and see if the character can fill them?

Dimitry: Or the other way around. We live in an industry that changes a lot,
it has to do with an industry that changes a lot.

## Cliques

Similar to the argument before, there are also places where there is a Clique
mentality. It is obvious that the place is run from a specific number of people
that do not allow anybody to get into their inner circle. They can decide for
example who gets involved in what for example their "mate" will get the
interesting projects or the ones that have high impact, when the time comes
for valuation or promotions these "mates" will shine since they did this for
the company or that which had very high impact.


In a similar fashion there can be a department which for some reason can impose
itself on others, as an example a sales team selling whatever they want and
then dropping it into the rest of the company and asking them to implement it
while they cash in their bonuses.

We are not discussing the case where people get more close together, socialize,
and become friends like play football after work. We are discussing the case
where there is huge interference with the rest of the company.

---

Jason: Based on what Socrates mentioned, I want to talk about cliques. You as
a new guy will never be part of this. You go there never enter that clique. At
the end after some time you will leave because you never got involved in the
good projects since they never came your way.

Socrates: Or there are different cliques operating at different levels. There
was that department that for some reason was always above everybody else...
A cabal running the whole thing.
...

Dimitry: I did not have that exact experience but I happened to talk to someone
who told me that a place was "a little bit too cliquey" which I did not like
because it was served as something that people should somehow swallow and get
along. No it is not something you should swallow, it is a red flag.

Jason: Yes and because it is difficult to solve, you need to recognize that
from the interview hence why we discuss it here.

Socrates: Or it might be something benign like people hanging out together
after work to play football. That's OK as long as it does not interfere with
the rest.

## Do That Now - One Hour

This is the offspring of "Puzzle Mania" with the "Lots of work up front",
where you end up doing some online tests that you have to finish in ONE HOUR
NO MATTER WHAT!

Problems with this approach have to do with how people react to deadlines,
one of us due to previous past experiences has knee-jerk reaction like
"why in one hour?", "Can we negotiate this?", and so forth. Also in real life
(IRL) how many day to day tasks need to finish within exactly an hour?
What happens if one finishes in half?

In some configurations the tasks can be easily finished in say 20 to 30 minutes
and the rest can be used for assurance or buffer. In some other cases it is
exactly one hour non-stop. Some companies treat it as a stress test since
some people can while others cannot function under tight constraints. There is
also the case of following the herd: if everybody does it so should I.

---

Dimitry: Related to the "write me code for 10 days" are those site that ask
you to solve problems within an hour. DO THAT NOW ONE HOUR.

Jason: I hate them so much...

Dimitry: I have a personal issue with that: when someone gives me a deadline
out of the blue, my brain rebels and freezes. I am in "no I want to think" or
"negotiate the deadline" mode.

Jason: These things have nothing to do with actual working conditions, how many
tasks need to finish within an hour?

Dimitry: Or if I finish in half, what do I do with the remaining time?

Jason: Or if you need three? Will you be fired? Don't get it.

Dimitry: I have seen some that can be done in far less time, some others take
one hour non-stop. I think that some times people are told to use them or
follow trends.

Jason: There are some people that cannot function under tight constraints.
Shows sometimes a luck of respect.

## No Career Progression

We came across this while talking with companies from a hiring platform: There
are companies that had a very good event like won a big contract or got to
their next funding round which is generally great news. On that stage they
want a number of people to help their offering take off, say get it to the
next stage from A to B. While talking to them there seemed that there was no
clue on what would happen after that, how would a person by joining their ranks
evolve after a "blood sweat and tears" period. For all one knows after their
offering becomes mature they might even downsize so the person who gave all
that hard work would go away.

These positions are good for someone who starts their career and there will
get exposed to many different experiences or for someone who wants this
know-how in order to do their own company. But generally the offering is
asymmetric since the the employer wants the employee to do the "extra" but
there is nothing at the end of it.

---

Dimitry: Another one that happened while I was looking were two or three
companies who were in a very good position of having won a big contract,
expanding, and wanted 10-15 developers to build their platform, take it off
from A to B to C. While talking with them there was no answer on what would
happen after that year, like OK we take it off, how will I continue to evolve
while being employed? There was the assumption that we had to work a lot for
that company, and once it reached a specific stage, then what would happen
next? They might need to downsize for example more maintaining stuff.

Jason: Like what will you do?

Dimitry: To one I asked it in this way: I see the whip but not a single carrot.
You want me to drop there like a paratrooper, organize stuff, solve difficult
problems which I am very willing to do so but then what? There was no answer.
Because themselves didn't know. I would do that when starting my career, at a
point when screwing up would be OK.

Socrates: A good experience.

Dimitry: Exactly, but now I have this experience, go there use it, there needs
to be something for me as well. Like extra money?

Socrates: Wrapping up, we need to check when there is extra effort asked, to
see that the returns are proportional. Or weight these things up, consider our
personal stage in life, family situation. If there is overtime, will they pay
us more? Teach us things? Send us to seminars? You want me go above my
contract, for what?

Jason: A good give and take.

Socrates: When you listen to many promises, be aware because promising is
different than delivering that promise. Or they want to awe you with a gym,
snack bar, ping-pong table, but not the time to enjoy them.

Dimitry: ... and we want to deduce as much information as possible from the
interviews and spotting red flags.


Socrates: As per usual sent us your red flags to add them in a subsequent
podcast.
All: Bye...


## What Would You Do?

With the post being about what we did not like, some notes on what we feel more
at home with. It happens that one of us has an upcoming book,
www.itarchetypes.com which suggests a framework. In short the candidates should
be profiled on how they see themselves in the industry and what the company
believes it needs at the specific time. For some of us our work is our passion,
for some our career, and for some just a job. Based on the position and the
phase of the company (starting, expanding, maintaining) or the specific
department different people fit or not fit. We need to acknowledge that this
approach is more applicable to technical fields than say sales.

A listener came with his approach which we loosely translated:

> One way that I prefer is to give them a small problem,
> not a puzzle, and ask them to provide a solution. There might be an algorithm
> behind it, there might not. Based on experience and capability the candidate
> will reach an answer with or without having the specific knowledge taught
> recently or fresh.

Socrates: Say you have your own company and you need to hire someone, what
would you do?

Dimitry: I might need to hire someone this very moment, I am leaning towards
the daughter of a friend of mine a-la Greece, Brazil: family members first.
I happen to have my own framework.
Socrates + Jason chorus: Something very difficult to grasp.

Dimitry: I am referring to the Commando/Infantry/Police separation.

Jason: Which is from the upcoming book: www.itarchetypes.com

Dimitry: If you want someone who knows stuff, has passion, is "in the game", I
want to see interest beyond work: like go to Github/Gitlab and see a project.
If you go now to my profiles you will see projects that I did just because I
wanted to. Does a person on their own time learn about crypto-currencies?
When I was a kid people were experimenting with installing Linux distributions,
a little bit later by development for mobile devices. Do you use Linux as your
main operating system? Have you tried to build something like a mobile app?
So when I want to hire for passion I look for these. What I am trying to
check is if this person has this thing as a hobby.

Socrates: I like this approach.

Dimitry: On the second one being a professional...

Jason: which is that?

Dimitry: Infantry. How good professional is this person. They know how to do
a job and they do it well. This is for positions with check-boxes, places where
people will have to tick items in a list. You work with a matrix here: look at
the CV, how close are the skills to what you need...

Socrates: Up to now I do not see a puzzle or a test anywhere...

Dimitry: That's because there are none. I might ask for something to see
if we match.

Socrates: So a little bit of work for free?

Dimitry: Not like that. I recently had to train a friend so I went to Euler
site and picked up some easy problems from there. I asked him to implement them
and discuss the answer. Now if he wanted to continue practicing after that, he
would have the points with him, his profile, etc. He would take-away what
he did. If you remember we had discussed a submission.

Socrates: Nod.

Jason: Maybe you are able to do it because you are on a very technical field.
I do not think that one can do something like that in marketing.

Dimitry: And the last category are people for which the whole thing is just a
job. Passive, want to follow instructions all the time, suitable for large
companies that want bodies, do not want to have anything to do with them in a
small shop. I cannot communicate with them so want to stay away.

Jason: Usually these people are in the wrong industry. People with "low will"

Socrates: Or in a stage in life where you want to do the minimum and get home
to wife or husband and kids.

Dimitry: This is what you also expect from a professional.

Socrates: I have seen with many people: at 16:59 PC starts the shutdown
sequence. Do the absolute minimum from the assigned tasks, and that's it.

Jason: What Dimitry tries to communicate is that this person will leave the
office, go home and that should be it. Dimitry describes someone who likes
what they do even away from the office.

Dimitry: There are many ways to treat something in this way. Some times it is
because of circumstance, where we have all been in our lives: there are other
things going on. We want to do our tasks and go home, or just for some people
it is their life-stance. I had a good and close friend who is not with us any
more (Rest In Peace George), who did not care about his career at all,
something he had communicated to me: "I am into sailing - period." At that
point he found a position in a certain organization where he would be doing
exactly the same tasks for 20 years at least.
...

Dimitry: So I would try to deduce these things from a candidate.

Jason: If the other person wants to do sailing, he wanted one job to fund his
hobby.

Dimitry: The difference though from Infantry and Police is that this person
would do the job as good as possible.

Jason: The people in the third (Police) category are not people that do not
perform well, it is just that they do not care.

Socrates: The absolute minimum.

Jason: Whatever they are told to do they will do and they just do not care.
Go to the office do what told, get the money and leave. While the other
categories find some joy in it.

Dimitry: Either joy or see it as a professional trajectory. Better stop here.
But things like if I learn this, I will be able to do that so I will change
my compensation to something else or the environment, so when they go to a
position they want to digest things and learn from them, etc. Let's go to the
next.


Update (from listener): One way that I prefer is to give them a small problem,
not a puzzle, and ask them to provide a solution. There might be an algorithm
behind it, there might not. Based on experience and capability the candidate
will reach an answer with or without having the specific knowledge taught
recently or fresh.
