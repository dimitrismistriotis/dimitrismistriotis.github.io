# Red Flags in Interviews

This is a transcribe with some modifications of the discussion we had for the
podcast [FetaReport](www.fetareport.gr). Unfortunately the original content is
in Greek so unless you are on of those Mediterraneans it will not be of much
use. We thought that it might be good to release our content for an
international audience. Before I start on a side note, the podcast is about
people of our generation who have moved abroad and as first-generation
immigrants have to adjust to their new country which for the three of us is UK.
If you think that such content would be of interest to you even if spoken with
funny accents, please reach out to us or leave a comment here so that we will
be able to react to your feedback and start releasing stuff in English.

## Introduction

Recently two members of the crew, Socrates and Dimitry had gone out to look for
positions, while the other member Jason had been in the same situation some
months before. Reading  the job descriptions and taking the corresponding phone
calls (initial or later stage) we saw some patterns emerging which at some
point started documenting for the podcast.

Before we start it is important to note that there is no perfect job, that a
red flag for one person might be a green flag for another and that also what
we want from a job depends on our personality, lifestyle, stages in life (e.g.:
single, married, family) or in one word, our "situation". With that in mind a
"we work all day long" signal might be a red flag for a family man but a
"wow I will learn a lot" for a young single person who wants to acquire
experience.

With the above in mind lets start.


## People

Socrates: Works in design, UI/UX.
Jason: Digital Marketing.
Dimitry (me): IT, Software Engineer.

## Lots of work up front

Socrates: The first read flag I have encountered were those cases where the
potential employer was asking for so much work **before** getting into the
late stages of the interview. Stuff like: "yeah, you look so great, we
definitely want to interview you, but we would like you to build an app if
possible from scratch", this is followed by: "it should not take more than
10 hours" as if I can magically create 10 hours out of thin air.
Jason: In the marketing section I have encountered this by people asking me to
perform small tasks which never take more than two or three hours. For both
of you people ask you a lot.
Socrates: By talking to someone who is very experienced in the field, they
identified it as a plague of the industry. For this person the aim is not so
much to see if you are capable of working in that capacity, they usually want
to see if you are willing to give ten hours in order to work there.
Dimitry: From an IT angle, because I am a bit middle aged. Many years before
there was a study on the graduates of a specific Indian university where
a big amount of people could not even write a small program. I had tried with
a student of mine to see if they could write a program implementing the so
called FIZZ-BUZZ algorithm (LINKS HERE). So these tests were put in place
initially to filter out those people that could not function at all.
Jason: What you suggest though is a 20-30 minute task, Socrates talked about
10s of hours per company.
Dimitry: This is where the whole thing went south like a lot. Initially it
was a good way to filter out people that were not there yet. There are many
companies that offer this as a service. You give 3-4 tasks like this for the
person to take them up front which covers for the case that they have
memorized a couple. When this thing started about 40% of people were instantly
rejected.
Jason: Again you are talking about an hour or so. Many companies give briefs
which would be potentially take a team months asking you to squeeze something
within 10 hours which easily become 40.
Socrates: I understand that you need to "work on" the job that you want to
end up to. On the other hand asking for creative work which might also be used
for something they need later on, even if you are not hired, goes way over the
top.
Jason: I can understand asking something small...
Socrates: This is why we have portfolios. Looking at a portfolio should be
enough to get the idea.
Dimitry: Without wanting to justify this behavior is say that we know or assume
that this person can perform say from the portfolio. Next question is: can this
person function on our team as it currently is? You give them a task and the
team that they want to interact with, leave some loose ends or some stuff
totally undefined. Say for example that what color to use somewhere as a
trivial example is not defined. Will Socrates make a decision on his own and
put something that fits, leave it colorless aiming to discuss later, or reach
out to someone else within the company. All of the above are valid approaches
but which one works best for the specific corporate or team culture?
Jason: Only huge companies are able to do this like get you there for a day
and experiment.
Socrates: Yes there are some companies that invite you for some hours or for
a day to see if you fit on their environment.
Dimitry: Exactly a degraded/decadent version of this is having to do a two day
task.
Socrates: You wish it was for two days.
Jason: I think this is unacceptable they take over your personal life. It is
like "us the big company are doing a favor to consider your application and
you need to prove that you are worthy" ...
Socrates: ... and also you have applied only to them and you have nothing else
going on with your life no other applications and not a job or anything.

Dimitry + Socrates + Jason: Let's go to the next one.

## Fast Paced Environment

Socrates: Something else that we recently encountered was the so called
"fast paced environment". We have very tight deadlines, we move very fast...
Jason: Work hard play hard.
Socrates: Exactly and also the thing that came up lots recently: "our people
stay longer hours, but it is why they want to, nobody forces them to do so".
Jason: I have also heard this it is very irritating.
Socrates: Which is by itself a big warning sign. Who wants to sit forever in
the office.
Dimitry: Some times I do not.
Jason: This is not something you normally say in the interview, Sometimes I
want to stay a bit longer, it is hot outside, I want to finish some small
things, for any reason.
Socrates: Yes, it is, or you want to do it. It is not forever nor everybody
wants to do it every single day.
Dimitry: There are many interpretations, what this means to me: I might stay
in the office a bit longer if there is say a technology I want to learn and it
is important to me and my career and I want to grab that knowledge. Second and
most important if this is being recognized financially in the bottom line and
generally. That last detail is something that is conveniently not mentioned
from those interviewers.
Socrates: The difference here is that Dimitry wants to do so for his agenda
and reasons, when it is "everybody" or "the majority", it does not ring a bell,
It is like the whole of Notre Damme.
Jason: This is what was happening in the previous place that I was which can
be described as "hell". They said to me that they work hard and play hard,
sometimes stay a little bit longer. We had many customers from the States so
many times you had to stay longer to talk to them over the phone because of
the time difference. Makes sense and seemed totally OK, this was the pitch in
the interview. They said precisely "every once in a while".
The endgame was that I ended up going there 08:00 in the morning, one hour
earlier than what was in the contract in order to conduct "meetings" to
"organize" the department with every day leaving the office after 19:00/20:00.
This was not because of talks with clients or anything, there was nothing well
organized, not a good work-life balance which was constantly causing issues.
Dimitry: I think here there is a subliminal issue here: I do not have proper
management or project management, there is nobody to properly coordinate things
or anything like that, something that we used to have all over in Greece. The
only way in this environment to get a result is leave the workhorses/plebs
work all day long.
Jason: When there is no organization which is also a red flag for later. There
is also the absence of communication. You might have to wait for a designer to
finalize his work for say 5 hours, with you in these five hours doing nothing
or fooling around (scratching yourself).


## Leader of Team of One - Responsible for Everything

Socrates: What is your opinion for roles where you are supposed to be a lead
and then while reading the description you find out that you will be doing
everything in a nice little compact package?
Jason: It is a trap, a trap for people that are somehow new in the field...
Dimitry: not necessarily.
Socrates: I have talked with people that want an UX designer but the also do
digital marketing so they want someone to do their banners for their ad
campaigns.
Jason: I had head that "we are entering your space now..."
Socrates: ... and we will build a department around you.
Dimitry: I have heard that as well. We will make a department around you
(note: I also once believed it).
Jason: Stay away 180 degree turn.
Dimitry: I have encountered it when interviewing while being senior. You cannot
lure a senior person by saying to them that they will have to do everything, so
you bait them by saying that they would be "head of development"
Socrates: ... and within a year we will hire more people ...
Dimitry: ... which you the head of development will be responsible to manage.
or as they say it in English: "build a team around you"
Jason: If in the interview they mention that department X will be build around
you is like a giant red flag. Why do I say this: when I got to where I am now
I was the most experienced from the whole team.
Dimitry: The Leader
Socrates: Cheering
Jason: After the party. There was nothing in the interview about me leading
a team. They gave one to me later on, when on interview they promise you
something like that, you leave.
Socrates: Even if there is a managerial position?
Jason: This is another thing, if the position says manager, then you wait to
see which team you will manage.
Socrates: We are talking about the promise of leading a team whose members have
not yet been hired.
Dimitry: And they are not tied up to their word for two reasons: Say that I
get into a company do the full developer thing and say that they do not like me
for any reason, we do not match. There is no law stopping them for hiring
another person and placing them to lead me, promising me that when they
actually hire the person after this one I will be leading them.
Secondly if I end up being a good developer, designer, whatever, management
might think: "hey wait a minute we found a guy performing well, which is
rare in our industry" followed by "why ruin this?". They are not willing to
"kill" a good developer and turn him to a manager for which there is no record
of previous performance at least within the company.
Jason: This is not a wrong approach.
Dimitry: Not at all, leave that person where they are and let us hire an
already experienced manager with a proven record.
Jason: From a managerial perspective this makes lots of sense.
Dimitry: It makes perfect sense but does not mean that it is beneficial to
you who got there waiting to become a manager.
Jason: Definitely not.
Dimitry: What I said to one, to finish chasing our tails, was to ask them if
they are willing to put that on my employment contract, put a clause that
within X months I will be managing a team.
Socrates: Alas! The moment you ask them to sign on what they bubble, there is
no way they will hire you. It signals that you want them to be held responsible
for what they say to you.
Dimitry: I wanted to say in a polite way: please hang up the phone like now.
Jason: I think he did well, he didn't say something bad.
Socrates: It has to do with timing. It would make sense to ask this to be
placed within the contract when the deal is closing. When you do that so early
on you are challenging what they just told you. When they say "within a year"
we will do a design department and you will be the lead, and your response is
well, lets put that into contract then something breaks. They want you to be
dying to get there doing everything, crying, thanking God to be there. You say
that you go there for this promise not for the company being a liability in
between.
Jason: But if you suggest it and they do it, it would be great.

## Puzzle Mania

Dimitry: Next, this looks like a permutation of the "tasks" one and has
happened to me mostly in big companies, is when in the interview you are asked
to solve puzzle after puzzle. You look at me as if I am an alien.
Jason: I have seen character puzzles...
Socrates: Like a personality trait test?
Dimitry: Algorithmic stuff. Shortest Paths, Double Linked Lists, etc. Stuff
that we do in Uni to understand how operating systems work and programming
language internals. One classic one is which is the fastest way to move packets
in a network.
Jason: This happened to a friend of mine, fresh out of Uni as well. It seems
something specific to your domain.
Dimitry: The problem here is that these questions are biased towards people
who have just graduated. In this way you are biased in favor of younger people.
This was the response of a company which was accused of age discrimination:
"everyone can join, we have an impartial interview process". Yes the interview
does not do age checks, only it asks questions that are easier to be answered
by recent graduates hence young people.
Socrates: And you have not been there since forever so go remember the
algorithms from back in the day.
Dimitry: Exactly
Socrates: Do you treat it as a way to bypass anti-discrimination checks?
Dimitry: Yes but not necessarily consciously.
Socrates: No?
Dimitry: Yes.
Jason: Give me an example.
Socrates: UK law does not allow you to prefer based on gender, race, age, etc.
This is a reason we do not put in this country our picture in the CV or mention
our sex.
Dimitry: We have a CV guide which we will link. LINK
Socrates: Big Taboo.
Dimitry: So they make an "impartial" process which involves asking for stuff
that only recent graduates know. I had seen this in myself as I was acing these
tests when I graduated as I did a late masters when 28/29. It is something
that you get good with practice. Most contemporary programming is not related
to algorithms and data structure manipulation so this knowledge wears off. By
throwing these questions to people you just favor the "youngsters"
Socrates: Say you have your own company and you need to hire someone, what
would you do?
Dimitry: I might need to hire someone this very moment, I am leaning towards
the daughter of a friend of mine a-la Greece, Brazil: family members first.
I happen to have my own framework.
Socrates + Jason chorus: Something very difficult to grasp.
Dimitry: I am referring to the Commando/Infantry/Police separation.
Jason: Which is from the upcoming book: www.itarchetypes.com
Dimitry: If you want someone who knows stuff, has passion, is "in the game", I
want to see interest beyond work: like go to Github/Gitlab and see a project.
If you go now to my profiles you will see projects that I did just because I
wanted to. Does a person on their own time learn about crypto-currencies?
When I was a kid people were experimenting with installing Linux distributions,
a little bit later by development for mobile devices. Do you use Linux as your
main operating system? Have you tried to build something like a mobile app?
So when I want to hire for passion I look for these. What I am trying to
check is if this person has this thing as a hobby.
Socrates: I like this approach.
Dimitry: On the second one being a professional...
Jason: which is that?
Dimitry: Infantry. How good professional is this person. They know how to do
a job and they do it well. This is for positions with check-boxes, places where
people will have to tick items in a list. You work with a matrix here: look at
the CV, how close are the skills to what you need...
Socrates: Up to now I do not see a puzzle or a test anywhere...
Dimitry: That's because there are none. I might ask for something to see
if we match.
Socrates: So a little bit of work for free?
Dimitry: Not like that. I recently had to train a friend so I went to Euler
site and picked up some easy problems from there. I asked him to implement them
and discuss the answer. Now if he wanted to continue practicing after that, he
would have the points with him, his profile, etc. He would take-away what
he did. If you remember we had discussed a submission.
Socrates: Nod.
Jason: Maybe you are able to do it because you are on a very technical field.
I do not think that one can do something like that in marketing.
Dimitry: And the last category are people for which the whole thing is just a
job. Passive, want to follow instructions all the time, suitable for large
companies that want bodies, do not want to have anything to do with them in a
small shop. I cannot communicate with them so want to stay away.
Jason: Usually these people are in the wrong industry.
