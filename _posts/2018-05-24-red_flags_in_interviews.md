# Red Flags in Interviews

This is a transcribe with some modifications of the discussion we had for the
podcast [FetaReport](www.fetareport.gr). Unfortunately the original content is
in Greek so unless you are on of those Mediterraneans it will not be of much
use. We thought that it might be good to release our content for an
international audience. Before I start on a side note, the podcast is about
people of our generation who have moved abroad and as first-generation
immigrants have to adjust to their new country which for the three of us is UK.
If you think that such content would be of interest to you even if spoken with
funny accents, please reach out to us or leave a comment here so that we will
be able to react to your feedback and start releasing stuff in English.
