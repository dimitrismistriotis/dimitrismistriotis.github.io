# Red Flags in Interviews

This is a transcribe with some modifications of the discussion we had for the
podcast [FetaReport](www.fetareport.gr). Unfortunately the original content is
in Greek so unless you are on of those Mediterraneans it will not be of much
use. We thought that it might be good to release our content for an
international audience. Before I start on a side note, the podcast is about
people of our generation who have moved abroad and as first-generation
immigrants have to adjust to their new country which for the three of us is UK.
If you think that such content would be of interest to you even if spoken with
funny accents, please reach out to us or leave a comment here so that we will
be able to react to your feedback and start releasing stuff in English.

## Introduction

Recently two members of the crew, Socrates and Dimitry had gone out to look for
positions, while the other member Jason had been in the same situation some
months before. Reading  the job descriptions and taking the corresponding phone
calls (initial or later stage) we saw some patterns emerging which at some
point started documenting for the podcast.

Before we start it is important to note that there is no perfect job, that a
red flag for one person might be a green flag for another and that also what
we want from a job depends on our personality, lifestyle, stages in life (e.g.:
single, married, family) or in one word, our "situation". With that in mind a
"we work all day long" signal might be a red flag for a family man but a
"wow I will learn a lot" for a young single person who wants to acquire
experience.

With the above in mind lets start.


## People

Socrates: Works in design, UI/UX.
Jason: Digital Marketing.
Dimitry (me): IT, Software Engineer.

## Lots of work up front

Socrates: The first read flag I have encountered were those cases where the
potential employer was asking for so much work **before** getting into the
late stages of the interview. Stuff like: "yeah, you look so great, we
definitely want to interview you, but we would like you to build an app if
possible from scratch", this is followed by: "it should not take more than
10 hours" as if I can magically create 10 hours out of thin air.
Jason: In the marketing section I have encountered this by people asking me to
perform small tasks which never take more than two or three hours. For both
of you people ask you a lot.
Socrates: By talking to someone who is very experienced in the field, they
identified it as a plague of the industry. For this person the aim is not so
much to see if you are capable of working in that capacity, they usually want
to see if you are willing to give ten hours in order to work there.
Dimitry: From an IT angle, because I am a bit middle aged. Many years before
there was a study on the graduates of a specific Indian university where
a big amount of people could not even write a small program. I had tried with
a student of mine to see if they could write a program implementing the so
called FIZZ-BUZZ algorithm (LINKS HERE). So these tests were put in place
initially to filter out those people that could not function at all.
Jason: What you suggest though is a 20-30 minute task, Socrates talked about
10s of hours per company.
Dimitry: This is where the whole thing went south like a lot. Initially it
was a good way to filter out people that were not there yet. There are many
companies that offer this as a service. You give 3-4 tasks like this for the
person to take them up front which covers for the case that they have
memorized a couple. When this thing started about 40% of people were instantly
rejected.
Jason: Again you are talking about an hour or so. Many companies give briefs
which would be potentially take a team months asking you to squeeze something
within 10 hours which easily become 40.
Socrates: I understand that you need to "work on" the job that you want to
end up to. On the other hand asking for creative work which might also be used
for something they need later on, even if you are not hired, goes way over the
top.
Jason: I can understand asking something small...
Socrates: This is why we have portfolios. Looking at a portfolio should be
enough to get the idea.
Dimitry: Without wanting to justify this behavior is say that we know or assume
that this person can perform say from the portfolio. Next question is: can this
person function on our team as it currently is? You give them a task and the
team that they want to interact with, leave some loose ends or some stuff
totally undefined. Say for example that what color to use somewhere as a
trivial example is not defined. Will Socrates make a decision on his own and
put something that fits, leave it colorless aiming to discuss later, or reach
out to someone else within the company. All of the above are valid approaches
but which one works best for the specific corporate or team culture?
Jason: Only huge companies are able to do this like get you there for a day
and experiment.
Socrates: Yes there are some companies that invite you for some hours or for
a day to see if you fit on their environment.
Dimitry: Exactly a degraded/decadent version of this is having to do a two day
task.
Socrates: You wish it was for two days.
Jason: I think this is unacceptable they take over your personal life. It is
like "us the big company are doing a favor to consider your application and
you need to prove that you are worthy" ...
Socrates: ... and also you have applied only to them and you have nothing else
going on with your life no other applications and not a job or anything.

Dimitry + Socrates + Jason: Let's go to the next one.

## Fast Paced Environment

Socrates: Something else that we recently encountered was the so called
"fast paced environment". We have very tight deadlines, we move very fast...
Jason: Work hard play hard.
Socrates: Exactly and also the thing that came up lots recently: "our people
stay longer hours, but it is why they want to, nobody forces them to do so".
Jason: I have also heard this it is very irritating.
Socrates: Which is by itself a big warning sign. Who wants to sit forever in
the office.
Dimitry: Some times I do not.
Jason: This is not something you normally say in the interview, Sometimes I
want to stay a bit longer, it is hot outside, I want to finish some small
things, for any reason.
Socrates: Yes, it is, or you want to do it. It is not forever nor everybody
wants to do it every single day.
Dimitry: There are many interpretations, what this means to me: I might stay
in the office a bit longer if there is say a technology I want to learn and it
is important to me and my career and I want to grab that knowledge. Second and
most important if this is being recognized financially in the bottom line and
generally. That last detail is something that is conveniently not mentioned
from those interviewers.
Socrates: The difference here is that Dimitry wants to do so for his agenda
and reasons, when it is "everybody" or "the majority", it does not ring a bell,
It is like the whole of Notre Damme.
Jason: This is what was happening in the previous place that I was which can
be described as "hell". They said to me that they work hard and play hard,
sometimes stay a little bit longer. We had many customers from the States so
many times you had to stay longer to talk to them over the phone because of
the time difference. Makes sense and seemed totally OK, this was the pitch in
the interview. They said precisely "every once in a while".
The endgame was that I ended up going there 08:00 in the morning, one hour
earlier than what was in the contract in order to conduct "meetings" to
"organize" the department with every day leaving the office after 19:00/20:00.
This was not because of talks with clients or anything, there was nothing well
organized, not a good work-life balance which was constantly causing issues.
Dimitry: I think here there is a subliminal issue here: I do not have proper
management or project management, there is nobody to properly coordinate things
or anything like that, something that we used to have all over in Greece. The
only way in this environment to get a result is leave the workhorses/plebs
work all day long.
Jason: When there is no organization which is also a red flag for later. There
is also the absence of communication. You might have to wait for a designer to
finalize his work for say 5 hours, with you in these five hours doing nothing
or fooling around (scratching yourself).


## Leader of Team of One - Responsible for Everything

Socrates: What is your opinion for roles where you are supposed to be a lead
and then while reading the description you find out that you will be doing
everything in a nice little compact package?
Jason: It is a trap, a trap for people that are somehow new in the field...
Dimitry: not necessarily.
Socrates: I have talked with people that want an UX designer but the also do
digital marketing so they want someone to do their banners for their ad
campaigns.
Jason: I had head that "we are entering your space now..."
Socrates: ... and we will build a department around you.
Dimitry: I have heard that as well. We will make a department around you
(note: I also once believed it).
Jason: Stay away 180 degree turn.
Dimitry: I have encountered it when interviewing while being senior. You cannot
lure a senior person by saying to them that they will have to do everything, so
you bait them by saying that they would be "head of development"
Socrates: ... and within a year we will hire more people ...
Dimitry: ... which you the head of development will be responsible to manage.
or as they say it in English: "build a team around you"
Jason: If in the interview they mention that department X will be build around
you is like a giant red flag. Why do I say this: when I got to where I am now
I was the most experienced from the whole team.
Dimitry: The Leader
Socrates: Cheering
Jason: After the party. There was nothing in the interview about me leading
a team. They gave one to me later on, when on interview they promise you
something like that, you leave.
Socrates: Even if there is a managerial position?
Jason: This is another thing, if the position says manager, then you wait to
see which team you will manage.
Socrates: We are talking about the promise of leading a team whose members have
not yet been hired.
Dimitry: And they are not tied up to their word for two reasons: Say that I
get into a company do the full developer thing and say that they do not like me
for any reason, we do not match. There is no law stopping them for hiring
another person and placing them to lead me, promising me that when they
actually hire the person after this one I will be leading them.
Secondly if I end up being a good developer, designer, whatever, management
might think: "hey wait a minute we found a guy performing well, which is
rare in our industry" followed by "why ruin this?". They are not willing to
"kill" a good developer and turn him to a manager for which there is no record
of previous performance at least within the company.
Jason: This is not a wrong approach.
Dimitry: Not at all, leave that person where they are and let us hire an
already experienced manager with a proven record.
Jason: From a managerial perspective this makes lots of sense.
Dimitry: It makes perfect sense but does not mean that it is beneficial to
you who got there waiting to become a manager.
Jason: Definitely not.
Dimitry: What I said to one, to finish chasing our tails, was to ask them if
they are willing to put that on my employment contract, put a clause that
within X months I will be managing a team.
Socrates: Alas! The moment you ask them to sign on what they bubble, there is
no way they will hire you. It signals that you want them to be held responsible
for what they say to you.
Dimitry: I wanted to say in a polite way: please hang up the phone like now.
Jason: I think he did well, he didn't say something bad.
Socrates: It has to do with timing. It would make sense to ask this to be
placed within the contract when the deal is closing. When you do that so early
on you are challenging what they just told you. When they say "within a year"
we will do a design department and you will be the lead, and your response is
well, lets put that into contract then something breaks. They want you to be
dying to get there doing everything, crying, thanking God to be there. You say
that you go there for this promise not for the company being a liability in
between.
Jason: But if you suggest it and they do it, it would be great.

## Puzzle Mania

Dimitry: Next, this looks like a permutation of the "tasks" one and has
happened to me mostly in big companies, is when in the interview you are asked
to solve puzzle after puzzle. You look at me as if I am an alien.
Jason: I have seen character puzzles...
Socrates: Like a personality trait test?
Dimitry: Algorithmic stuff. Shortest Paths, Double Linked Lists, etc. Stuff
that we do in Uni to understand how operating systems work and programming
language internals. One classic one is which is the fastest way to move packets
in a network.
Jason: This happened to a friend of mine, fresh out of Uni as well. It seems
something specific to your domain.
Dimitry: The problem here is that these questions are biased towards people
who have just graduated. In this way you are biased in favor of younger people.
This was the response of a company which was accused of age discrimination:
"everyone can join, we have an impartial interview process". Yes the interview
does not do age checks, only it asks questions that are easier to be answered
by recent graduates hence young people.
Socrates: And you have not been there since forever so go remember the
algorithms from back in the day.
Dimitry: Exactly
Socrates: Do you treat it as a way to bypass anti-discrimination checks?
Dimitry: Yes but not necessarily consciously.
Socrates: No?
Dimitry: Yes.
Jason: Give me an example.
Socrates: UK law does not allow you to prefer based on gender, race, age, etc.
This is a reason we do not put in this country our picture in the CV or mention
our sex.
Dimitry: We have a CV guide which we will link. LINK
Socrates: Big Taboo.
Dimitry: So they make an "impartial" process which involves asking for stuff
that only recent graduates know. I had seen this in myself as I was acing these
tests when I graduated as I did a late masters when 28/29. It is something
that you get good with practice. Most contemporary programming is not related
to algorithms and data structure manipulation so this knowledge wears off. By
throwing these questions to people you just favor the "youngsters"
Socrates: Say you have your own company and you need to hire someone, what
would you do?
Dimitry: I might need to hire someone this very moment, I am leaning towards
the daughter of a friend of mine a-la Greece, Brazil: family members first.
I happen to have my own framework.
Socrates + Jason chorus: Something very difficult to grasp.
Dimitry: I am referring to the Commando/Infantry/Police separation.
Jason: Which is from the upcoming book: www.itarchetypes.com
Dimitry: If you want someone who knows stuff, has passion, is "in the game", I
want to see interest beyond work: like go to Github/Gitlab and see a project.
If you go now to my profiles you will see projects that I did just because I
wanted to. Does a person on their own time learn about crypto-currencies?
When I was a kid people were experimenting with installing Linux distributions,
a little bit later by development for mobile devices. Do you use Linux as your
main operating system? Have you tried to build something like a mobile app?
So when I want to hire for passion I look for these. What I am trying to
check is if this person has this thing as a hobby.
Socrates: I like this approach.
Dimitry: On the second one being a professional...
Jason: which is that?
Dimitry: Infantry. How good professional is this person. They know how to do
a job and they do it well. This is for positions with check-boxes, places where
people will have to tick items in a list. You work with a matrix here: look at
the CV, how close are the skills to what you need...
Socrates: Up to now I do not see a puzzle or a test anywhere...
Dimitry: That's because there are none. I might ask for something to see
if we match.
Socrates: So a little bit of work for free?
Dimitry: Not like that. I recently had to train a friend so I went to Euler
site and picked up some easy problems from there. I asked him to implement them
and discuss the answer. Now if he wanted to continue practicing after that, he
would have the points with him, his profile, etc. He would take-away what
he did. If you remember we had discussed a submission.
Socrates: Nod.
Jason: Maybe you are able to do it because you are on a very technical field.
I do not think that one can do something like that in marketing.
Dimitry: And the last category are people for which the whole thing is just a
job. Passive, want to follow instructions all the time, suitable for large
companies that want bodies, do not want to have anything to do with them in a
small shop. I cannot communicate with them so want to stay away.
Jason: Usually these people are in the wrong industry. People with "low will"
Socrates: Or in a stage in life where you want to do the minimum and get home
to wife or husband and kids.
Dimitry: This is what you also expect from a professional.
Socrates: I have seen with many people: at 16:59 PC starts the shutdown
sequence. Do the absolute minimum from the assigned tasks, and that's it.
Jason: What Dimitry tries to communicate is that this person will leave the
office, go home and that should be it. Dimitry describes someone who likes
what they do even away from the office.
Dimitry: There are many ways to treat something in this way. Some times it is
because of circumstance, where we have all been in our lives: there are other
things going on. We want to do our tasks and go home, or just for some people
it is their life-stance. I had a good and close friend who is not with us any
more (Rest In Peace George), who did not care about his career at all,
something he had communicated to me: "I am into sailing - period." At that
point he found a position in a certain organization where he would be doing
exactly the same tasks for 20 years at least.
...
Dimitry: So I would try to deduce these things from a candidate.
Jason: If the other person wants to do sailing, he wanted one job to fund his
hobby.
Dimitry: The difference though from Infantry and Police is that this person
would do the job as good as possible.
Jason: The people in the third (Police) category are not people that do not
perform well, it is just that they do not care.
Socrates: The absolute minimum.
Jason: Whatever they are told to do they will do and they just do not care.
Go to the office do what told, get the money and leave. While the other
categories find some joy in it.
Dimitry: Either joy or see it as a professional trajectory. Better stop here.
But things like if I learn this, I will be able to do that so I will change
my compensation to something else or the environment, so when they go to a
position they want to digest things and learn from them, etc. Let's go to the
next.

## You Will Learn the Domain

Dimitry: "You will learn the domain", have you come across that?
Socrates: Sometimes yes: we will teach you the domain but usually in a domain
that I have no interest about.
Jason: What do you mean as "learn the domain"? What do you learn?
Socrates: Something like a new technology such as banner making or generally
the industry on which the company operates. Say you will get in a bank and you
will learn how the finance system works.
Jason: ... and why is this bad?
Dimitry: I consider it a red flag, apart from being in a place that this was
messy, because it is just an excuse that our tech infrastructure and things
that have to do with your profession are poo-y. For example: no good
infrastructure not good procedures, things left up in the air, so what do I
have to give to you? Domain knowledge.
Jason: Have you heard this often?
Socrates: Not a lot.
Dimitry: Let me give an example, say the company is in the health sector so
they say to you that you will interact a lot with doctors and you will learn
how the medical space works, or a space that is supposed to have lots of money
moving around, and with that you will be able to evolve. OK up to here?
Jason: Yes. Got it.
Dimitry: In this example there is no project management, QA, other roles, so
the programmer/developer interacts with the Doctor out of the blue. Means that
the developer is also doing the specifications, or that any given time the
client can talk to them so they have no quiet time to concentrate or work
uninterrupted. That because doctor X can call any time and interrupt you.
Socrates: Not I got it, you will learn you will talk with people, they will
teach you things about the industry. Usually they push you one step out of
what you are supposed to be doing as a professional. Not do more or better like
outside your comfort zone, do things unrelated with your profession.
Jason: That does not happen a lot in marketing because it is client facing per
se, so you need to interact with them.

## Sink or Swim

Jason: Something else is when you finish with the interview get hired and they
just throw you in the middle of the place with you having to figure out
everything.
Socrates: Love it.
Jason: Not even how the infrastructure works, go figure it out, no on-boarding.
Socrates: Specially if you are not hired as Senior, or principal, or the
adjective that is now in fashion.
Jason: Ninja
PICTURE OF A NINJA HERE
Socrates: Unicorn! Unicorn designer. The absolute perfection. If you are lead
of the planet, say OK. But even as a junior.
Jason: Not necessarily, even the basics: where is the coffee and where is the
sugar.
Socrates: Yes, I assume that you need to be introduced to to culture of the
company.
Jason: Where are the bathrooms. :).
Socrates: Stuff like how they manage tickets at Jira (too technical).
Jason: When to call out a client. When do you call out, does someone else need
to talk first? Is it OK to interrupt people when they talk to ask questions?
Socrates: Is it out of experience?
Jason: Yes.
Socrates: Give us an example.
Jason: In the previous place there was no on-boarding at all and on top of this
they were complaining if/when you were doing something wrong. Once a client
asked me something in an email and I answered immediately. I was told from my
manager that I should have asked him before reaching out. I would have to be
involved in guesswork on whom to ask, when to ask, when not to ask, what is OK,
what is not OK?
Socrates: Got it.
Jason: I think Dimitry had something like that recently.
Dimitry: I did, I am still not completely detached, my heart now is beating
faster and I am ready to say something bad about the mother of the person I was
working with.
Jason: PTSD?
Dimitry: I am trying to relax so I cal talk, also had some coffee.
Jason: He has turned red, breathing heavily.
Socrates: See the vain ready to pop out.
Dimitry: I am ready to take a tube, go there, lease, since we had a discussion
about leasing, a Kalashnikov.
Socrates: It is Saturday, nobody is there.
Dimitry: I will wait until Monday behind the bell of the nearby Church.
Socrates: Share us your experience calmly then.
Dimitry: I cannot do so, so no. How do spot this though. You listen to catch
phrases like: "commit code on the first day", "you will have impact on the
first days"...
Socrates: You will hit the ground running!
Jason + Dimitry: Yeah
Dimitry: "Commit production code in the first days". When I first encountered
this thought that all these things would happen with the assistance of a person
who was already there for some time guiding my steps. From point those
"training wheels" would be utilized less and less.
Jason: Not talking about how to do your job, but how to function within that
organization.
Dimitry: Where this thing happened to me, I lost an afternoon because some
tests were not working. I fixed them. Once I fixed them I found out that they
were not used at all anywhere. Went to my manager and told him that one
afternoon got wasted, you might want to know about the deadline. Should not you
be on top of me before I did so? "No" (his answer). We will inform you dear
audience about the end of that story in a later transmission/podcast.
The other thing that happens on our field is that you will write production
code from the first day, Facebook was doing this at some point, but
"production" can be something so trivial as changing the color of a button.
Socrates: Something very small.
Dimitry: So that you will start interacting with the system from the first day.
This is OK
Jason: Let me bring another example. This was my first UK job, which had some
issues but their on-boarding was at least fantastic: On the first month you
were shadowing Seniors, or working under their supervision without having
immediate responsibilities.
Socrates: Generally my on-boarding experiences were amazing with the exception
of a single start-up. Do you believe that these things happen more in startups
and less in established companies which have some capital and resources, so in
the first months that you are learning things, there is no negative impact?
Jason: I think that in very big companies there would be an HR department which
would have implemented procedures, in SMEs...
Socrates: I am talking below mid.
Jason: I do not think it has to do with size, in many companies people have
become managers with no previous experience or training in management only
because they have been employed for the last say 10 years.
Dimitry: Or two years, but they happened to be there when the company started.

## Projects Build around Rick

Dimitry: Another one which I did not know how to name, is when "projects
have been build around Rick".
Jason: We read some related articles in Medium and we will provide some links.
The article speaks about places that have hired someone senior or someone with
lots of experience and then force everybody else or even the whole company to
gravitate around these people. Projects and the whole company become so
dependent on them that once they leave.

* https://startupsventurecapital.com/you-fired-your-top-talent-i-hope-youre-happy-cf57c41183dd

Socrates: And when they leave...
Jason: Chaos comes in.
Jason: I have seen people crippling the whole company.
Dimitry: So the magic Jonathan Ive comes in and has build something that
somehow works, and then it is cast in stone. If they prefer a specific
methodology than everybody else has to follow suite even if they are not happy
with this particular methodology. Even if everybody else disagrees we have to
listen to the prima-donna.
This shows up in interviews where the questions are tailored to see if you
answer what that person would like to hear.
Jason: In the previous place I was, our lead developer was involved in ALL
our projects - with ownership and setting up processes. He was a little
difficult as person to interact with. His ways were too complicated and hard
to understand. There was a project that dragged for 8 months while it could
have been done in three because "Rick" - that person - was saying that he
had to rewrite this, or that we needed to build this thing from scratch and so
on, moving back and forth.
Dimitry: The question is how this is can be discovered on the interview.
Sometimes Rick will be involved in the interview process and ask questions that
do not have a right or wrong answer, when you answer something that contradicts
his ways, he will say something like: "yes but if we did this" and immediately
the whole room will "wow" on what they just heard, although again it was an
open question.
Socrates: Sometimes they say it to you: we use an in-house platform that our
lead developer has built. Independent on if that person has dome things right
or wrong or anything, this is how thing should work and he should have the
full control of everything. They found that poor or many times not so poor
soul and all the projects are on his shoulders.
Dimitry: This where we have a potentially "sick"/"problematic"/"dysfunctional"
relationship between Rick and that company. Company has allowed Rick to do
whatever he wants, Rick is doing so, at the expense of existing or new
employees.
Jason: Not when the company already has that "Rick" and there is that situation
which you might want to avoid. There is also the company that wants to hire
you so that you will become their Rick, with you ending up to work 48 hours
per day.
Dimitry: For me it is not about time or amount of work, but also the quality
of the relationship. You see going into places where there is a person who is
there for say 15 years, or 10 and everybody else is there for 2 years. The
mind goes instantly to the question: what happened and there are not any people
for 4 years, or 6? The answer is that people could not bear it any longer.
Socrates: Like working with legacy code?
Dimitry: Like spending their working hours as the satellite of that "Rick".

## Skills do not Matter

Jason: Another red flag which I have encountered and want your opinion is when
you go to interviews and they say to you that they do not hire based on skills
but based on what type of person you are, your character.
Socrates: Is this bad?
Jason: Invalidating everything you can do? Or the contrary: we only care about
your skill-set not about your personality.
Dimitry: It has happened to me from a company that I will not name. There was
a place where they had an intermediary CTO who liked to hire people based on
character. My final interview happened to be when his contract had finished, he
had handled over to the next CTO who was only interested in skills. These two
people have different approaches. I went to the last interview with an agenda
that HR had sent me with questions all about character. When I got there the
new CTO started asking me about previous experience and skills. At some point
I stopped him and said something in the lines of "hey buddy, your HR gave me
this agenda and you are not touching it, what is going on?". At that point I
realized there would not be a match.
Socrates: Sometimes character checks are to identify if you will be part of
our clique. I am not talking about gentrification or Uber style recruitment,
mentioning it after things in the news about them hiring only people that
there were just like them.
Dimitry: I will tell a story that I got from a friend named George, I do not
have his permission, so will use only first name. George happened to meet a
multi-billionaire, at that time in his life, George had a problem hiring people
in the company that he was working for. That company had a skills matrix
approach. He had a matrix of skills, these were rare in that region so most
candidates scored really low.
Socrates: What is that matrix?
Dimitry: You create a matrix of what you want. Say I want a person to be a good
designer, average communicator, this good-to-have, this at OK levels, etc.
This goes in the "columns" of that matrix. The candidates go to the rows where
you see who "ticks" and who "X-es". It is like the feature comparison we see
in product offerings. So you get that Socrates has 20% match, Jason 25%, and
Dimitry 10%. The person higher is the most preferred candidate. But because
this is the way you see the world, mapping people to skills, everybody can
potentially have a gap, like these people fit 80%. This is very useful for
companies that want to project people to a number so that they then will be
able to compare them in a way.
The multi-billionaire told him that this was wrong and that my friend should
hire based on character: if a person has a good attitude, they will "grow" to
fill the gaps in the skill-set, if the character of a person has flaws, even if
all the gaps are covered or all the boxes ticked when the position or the life
change then that person will not grow to fill that gap.
Jason: Yes but you need to cover some basics? If you say I will hire only based
on character you get into what we do in Greece: hire your best friend, your
second cousin.
Dimitry: This is not character.
Socrates: So start with skills and see if the character can fill them?
Dimitry: Or the other way around. We live in an industry that changes a lot,
it has to do with an industry that changes a lot.

## Cliques

Jason: Based on what Socrates mentioned, I want to talk about cliques. You as
a new guy will never be part of this. You go there never enter that clique. At
the end after some time you will leave because you never got involved in the
good projects since they never came your way.
Socrates: Or there are different cliques operating at different levels. There
was that department that for some reason was always above everybody else...
A cabal running the whole thing.
...
Dimitry: I did not have that exact experience but I happened to talk to someone
who told me that a place was "a little bit too cliquey" which I did not like
because it was served as something that people should somehow swallow and get
along. No it is not something you should swallow, it is a red flag.
Jason: Yes and because it is difficult to solve, you need to recognize that
from the interview hence why we discuss it here.
Socrates: Or it might be something benign like people hanging out together
after work to play football. That's OK as long as it does not interfere with
the rest.

## Do That Now - One Hour

Dimitry: Related to the "write me code for 10 days" are those site that ask
you to solve problems within an hour. DO THAT NOW ONE HOUR.
Jason: I hate them so much...
Dimitry: I have a personal issue with that: when someone gives me a deadline
out of the blue, my brain rebels and freezes. I am in "no I want to think" or
"negotiate the deadline" mode.
Jason: These things have nothing to do with actual working conditions, how many
tasks need to finish within an hour?
Dimitry: Or if I finish in half, what do I do with the remaining time?
Jason: Or if you need three? Will you be fired? Don't get it.
Dimitry: I have seen some that can be done in far less time, some others take
one hour non-stop. I think that some times people are told to use them or
follow trends.
Jason: There are some people that cannot function under tight constraints.
Shows sometimes a luck of respect.

## No Career Progression

Dimitry: Another one that happened while I was looking were two or three
companies who were in a very good position of having won a big contract,
expanding, and wanted 10-15 developers to build their platform, take it off
from A to B to C. While talking with them there was no answer on what would
happen after that year, like OK we take it off, how will I continue to evolve
while being employed? There was the assumption that we had to work a lot for
that company, and once it reached a specific stage, then what would happen
next? They might need to downsize for example more maintaining stuff.
Jason: Like what will you do?
Dimitry: To one I asked it in this way: I see the whip but not a single carrot.
You want me to drop there like a paratrooper, organize stuff, solve difficult
problems which I am very willing to do so but then what? There was no answer.
Because themselves didn't know. I would do that when starting my career, at a
point when screwing up would be OK.
Socrates: A good experience.
Dimitry: Exactly, but now I have this experience, go there use it, there needs
to be something for me as well. Like extra money?
Socrates: Wrapping up, we need to check when there is extra effort asked, to
see that the returns are proportional. Or weight these things up, consider our
personal stage in life, family situation. If there is overtime, will they pay
us more? Teach us things? Send us to seminars? You want me go above my
contract, for what?
Jason: A good give and take.
Socrates: When you listen to many promises, be aware because promising is
different than delivering that promise. Or they want to awe you with a gym,
snack bar, ping-pong table, but not the time to enjoy them.
Dimitry: ... and we want to deduce as much information as possible from the
interviews and spotting red flags.

Socrates: As per usual sent us your red flags to add them in a subsequent
podcast.
All: Bye...
