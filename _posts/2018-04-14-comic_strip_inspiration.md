# Comic Strip Inspiration for IT

Without much fanfare:

![Think Tank issue 07 2nd page - extract](/images/strips/think_tank-technology.jpg)

I had read the comic when it was released. Instead of trying to remember where
these panels were, decided to read it again.

I am not a military expert nor I know about modern aviation but this strip
perfectly captures the tension between a stable established solution be it
code-base, programming stack, deployment and maintenance infrastructure and a
new one as a different paradigm emerges.

Of course not everything new is certain that it will survive there is the chasm
that needs to be crossed before we are sure that a technology "will live".

There is also the recently popular as a term [Lindy effect](https://medium.com/incerto/an-expert-called-lindy-fdb30f146eaf) most
established things will survive more than new ones; I still really enjoy
writing shell scripts as wrappers, facilitators, mini utilities, stuff that got
invented in the 60s or something.

But yet I cannot feel bad for tech departments that keep fighting the last war,
that do not have a mechanism which will try the new "drones" (as in the strip)
and silently invigorate their products and other offerings. Places that at some
point are being overrun from competition and their only chance of survival is
to hire expensive consultants, places that still use DB2 in a world with lots
NoSQL that PGSql and MyMariaSQL rule the RDBMS world, wondering why people do
not want to join their company and their only hope is to recruit graduates with
a huge debt or poor immigrants.

But also many times the experienced pilot that has lots of dogfights can win
even if the other ones have a bright new F-3211239 with electronic ninja
drones. Sometimes the only thing you need is a good old shell script that can
go a long way.
