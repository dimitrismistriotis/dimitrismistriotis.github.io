# Why I will never work again for a "London" company (1)

I sit in a small meeting room of the US-based multinational for which I am currently employed with doors closed, facing a video screen on whichmy current manager summarises the latest appraisal and the changes that it will bring to my financial situation. The summary ends with three reasons on why my performance has been good. Suddenly my mind plays a nasty deja-vu trick projecting a very similar situation three to four years before in a meeting room similar to the one I am sitting right now belonging to a UK-based employer with my then line manager reading a printout on why I am not doing good and need improvement. The deja-vu tinkers with my head because in both cases the rational was exactly the same but with the exact opposite outcome!

The story continues with my current manager staring at the emotional emptiness of my face asking me if I am OK and why I don't look as happy as I really should be. I told him that I have been so surprised by the news that I am speechless. This was half of the truth the other half had to do with me contemplating on if I should write my opinion down or not processing the mini shock in the process.

My intention was not about producing a set of aphorisms or write a polemic against the current situation in the Greater London - perhaps UK - area. More than anything else it is a reflection on "the bad parts" that I encountered coming as an outsider then trying to integrate and ultimately failing to do so in the country's business culture.

I do not imply or suggest that things in United Kingdom are inherently bad or wrong. Having though a different perspective which I decided to keep, I think the situation falls short with regards to the following points. The factors interweave and overlap with each other as it usually happens with cultural elements. One might influence or cause another, so there is not an easy to follow linearity, which would make things easier to read. I apologise in advance.

Last although I am not a sociologist, I tend to believe that there are two main underlying factors that are responsible for the reasons below. First the class system because Britain and second a fixed mindset mentality because moving fast London. (note: Fixed mentallity as defined in XXX's book). Also decided to be brief followi the famous "Why Talented Creatives Are Leaving Your Shitty Agency": http://www.mobileinc.co.uk/2013/09/why-talented-creatives-are-leaving-your-shitty-agency/, aiming to produce a short read. Might come back and expand later in the future.

Generally it has to do with the following:

* A. Communication on a need to know basis.
* B. Master/Slave not Peer to Peer.
* B1. You serve the corporate hierarchy not the customers
* C. Excellence intolerance.
* D. Over reliant on how City/financial sector operates even for inherently different industries.
* E. Cultural baggage to a supposedly international environment - class mentality and similar behaviours.
* F. Glass walls

Maybe add "appearances over substance"

## A. Communication on a need to know basis

This has to do with communications among departments that serve different functions such as IT, Marketing, Customer Service etc. What I have observed is that a person might come from a department A and request something to be done from department B, "I want you to do this, please". The recipient is mostly only allowed to talk about the details of "this". It is generally not desired or even proper in some cases to ask why "this" should be done, what are the objectives, how does it contribute to the organisation's targets, if it is going to change in the near future.

I have seen people talking but not interacting, organisational communication looks like a computer systems sending requests and receiving responses, not like people working together. I have found in the past that having an open discussion and exposure to the bigger picture allows to serve clients better, as you know their needs, allows to be proactive, as you can guess what would be required, fill the gaps when the person of the other department is not available, empathise further.

Attempts to do so have been fought back with the following rationale: "Dimitry wants to be in a meeting room and talk all day instead of working", "There is a problem with his English comprehension as he does not seem to get what I told him to do, that's why he is asking too many questions", with my favourite being: "You are questioning me on how to do my job, you are a developer not a Marketing executive", "We are paying you to do your job, not tell us how to do ours".

On the complete opposite on the US-based for exactly the same behaviour a completely different response. With non-technical people they received it as at least an expression of flattery: he is not a zeros and ones guy, he wants to learn about us and what to do. Similar for more technical people as we would help each other better, with the discussion more formal: "how should as a developer structure my CSS so that it would be easier for you to maintain".

## B. Master/Slave not Peer to Peer

Very related to the previous one, borrowing a term from systems architecture, the internal external communication paths of communication flow and also hierarchy follow a "master/slave" not a "peer to peer" pattern.

In "master/slave" systems communication is conducted through requests and responses: Master side issues a request which Slave side needs to fulfil it and get back with an answer. Requests are unidirectional. On the contrast in Peer to Peer networks each peer wants to assist in achieving the system's purpose and the communication is bidirectional, each part of the system can issue requests and receive responses from other ones many times exchanging roles.

There are at least two implications of this: The first one is that relationships are extremely binary (apologies for another computer science term). Either you are the "Master" so what you said must be done with the information you provided or you simply execute. If things are arranged this way, IT's functions almost always fall on the "Slave" side. When work ends and you go home with a feeling of having been used. It is very sad. What makes it even more sad is that even in heavy IT companies that operate in this way, IT people do not have good representation.

The second implication is that very often things degrade into a game of Chinese whispers / broken telephone, specially when the "Master/Slave" relationship has more than two connected parts (A asks B, B asks C). People reluctant/scared/unaware of challenging and asking for specifics rush into delivering something that they understood was required which can be far from what is actually needed. A friend of mine summarised this very well with the above anecdote: "In the previous company that I worked, I found out that my manager was asking me to do what he thought his manager needed, many times missing the mark. Now his manager was telling him what he understood from discussions with the CEO, whose input he never verified. Essentially I was shooting in the dark with the information I had. My manager was more eager to show something even if we'd have to do it again and again because of the limited amount of feedback".

* B1. You serve the corporate hierarchy not the customers

The absence of providing context also has another side-effect. People not in direct contact either with the management or with the clientele are totally in the dark on what the market wants, what the specific set of customers that a company serves might need. They can only fulfil the requests of their supervisors ending up serving not... (CONSIDER REMOVING)

## C. Excellence intolerance.

I was trying to get to a striking pictorial to explain this, until luckily I stumbled to a diagram similar to this:

flawed/or not developed yet --> works without flaws / "bugs" --> Excellent

It seems over and over that the modus operandi with products or services has to do with reaching a "minimum acceptable standard". Once this is reached efforts are made to maintain it. London companies then try to charge as much as possible as if their product or service was of highest quality. There is more emphasis on being polite and make the customer feel important than improving the deliverable.

It seems that upon reaching an acceptable standard for a product or a service is the point where further development stops and all effort goes on optimising it, streamlining it while trying to charge as much as possible. Though for companies that dominate their sectors (say Amazon and retail), the "OK" stage serves as the starting point of the journey.

There also seems to be a preference for predictability and stability on delivering something mediocre against trying to improve the quality of the output. Improving quality needs experimentation which might occasionally affect output's stability, so no.

## D. Over reliant on how City/financial sector operates even for inherently different industries

It is conceptually more of a case of the previous section but it's extent makes it need to have a section of it's own.

It feels sometimes that the "City" engulfs Britain the way the octopus in NSA's satellite engulfs the world:

[Nrol-39](/images/nrol-39_logo.jpg)

If an approach of management/mentality/conviction works for the City, it has to magically apply
to anything else. If someone had been exposed to the money laundering/exploitative/work all day/backstabbing/cut-throat/sexist/generally rotten part of the world that it is London's financial centre, he is perfectly capable to govern any other business or government sector.

Some years before the CEO of the IT company that I had been recently employed gave a welcome speech to the newcomers. In his speech while addressing the company culture he brought up the memories of his days in the finance sector including the *"take a cab go home shower and come back"* at 7 o'clock in the morning experience. Afterwards he explained to us how he thought that the people in his company deserve to have a life and how proud he was to have created a company where work-life balance exists. While I really liked the person, I could not agree with his mentality, which was not entirely his: there was a board of directors that was checking and approving his decisions. He conveniently did not to mention the fact that his company was exploiting people ruining their careers by sticking them to antiquated technologies and approaches (as in the City), that the only way to achieve a better output was by working more, not by improving the way people worked or by any form of investment (as in the City), that a person high in the hierarchy could hire his son and another promote his girlfriend/receptionist to HR administrator bypassing any policies, meritocracy and other proper governance practices (as it happens often in the ...). He was a good CEO because he was not judged as an IT CEO but against the financial sector's expectations of the role.

Another angle of this approach that could also fit on the previous section has to do with many industries that operate on a charge per hour business model or on areas that involve linear scale of work time and profit. I have in front of me a list on how a property is being surveyed before purchase. I can understand that this is a very specific job that should be regulated, conducted in a certain way, have a very specific output and reporting and it totally makes sense: the output should be something very - very - specific. What I cannot understand is why the same approach should apply to every other industry.

## E. Cultural baggage to a supposedly international environment - class mentality and other behaviours.

Specifically London as a city and ecosystem projects an international mentality where everyone can come to work and contribute with his experiences and approach. Yet after working here it becomes very early obvious that many companies operate with a strict traditional approach. Allow some observations:

People seem to bring the class mentality to the workplace, treating management as the "higher" class whose wishes have to be religiously fulfilled without question. I have not seen in practice any attempts for transparency or justification of decisions according to corporate targets, just orders.

How a person should behave is mostly implied not taught. If someone does something considered wrong there will be no correction or a discussion about it. Just at some point in the near future he will see that the environment treats him differently.

Complaining in the open even for the smallest thing is considered wrong. Colleagues and management will react with a silent treatment and then punish the act of complaining itself and then maybe consider it's intent.

Preserving the status quo trumps everything else including efficiency. As an example people are never allows to discuss anything related to the company or any subject that might cause conflict such as personal views or beliefs. I find very interesting the fact that I used to know the sexual orientation of everyone in the office, but not what they vote.

The fact that people do not believe that things could be better or different.

On the contrary on both US based companies that I have been employed there was training on how to behave, how to raise a complaint, when to discuss work related issues and with whom, how to treat people independent of bias, and so forth. Adherence to these well written and understood rules should have you covered and safe. Small diversions are accepted within limits as well as adjustments to the local culture. Occasional misbehaviours are being corrected from management as soon as possible, there is no silent treatment giving that eerie feeling that things are not OK - but why? The feeling is that of safety and there is breathing space.

Whenever I did something wrong - to err is human - in the US based companies, I got notified as soon as possible which allowed me to apologise and correct my behaviour. When a person acted rude against me, he was asked to write an apology email. On the contrary in some cases that I did something wrong in a UK based company, I had to go there next morning to see that people were behaving differently. When someone acted in a bad way against me, he was NOT asked to apologise, because he was a local or a crony of the boss. This bridges us to the last argument...

## F. Glass walls

Up to now the "d" word was not referenced in any form referring to discrimination. Again when reading about it before moving here or listening about it, I thought it had to do with people that did not perform well, were inherently lazy or believed they were entitled to preferential behaviour or treatment because they where members of a specific minority group. Then I saw some stuff and well...

First of all dear UK, where are the foreign born founders and co-founders of businesses? Let's see this tweet:

https://twitter.com/valaafshar/status/605079192653414400

and image

http://cis.org/miano/92-top-tech-companies-created-us-were-founded-native-born-americans

What's going on? Is there some sort of omertà, why these topics are not discussed in the public?.

That was for starters and not that much important because not all of us want to start IT businesses. What I have observed though is what is technically called "unequal representation".
Checking the census data as of 2011: http://data.london.gov.uk/census/reports/ then "Country of Birth Snapshot" or https://londondatastore-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/hRg%3D2011-census-snapshot-country-of-birth.pdf, found the following image regarding country of birth of Londoners:

CENSUS IMAGE

Based on the above I would expect that in various companies there would be an equal distribution of the figures above on different levels. Although I do not know of any related statistics the empirical observation differs. I have seen many low level positions dominated by foreign born workers. This is usually followed to senior positions (such as senior developers). While we approach the C-positions we have the opposite trend. I have observed more than once the promotion of a local against more competent foreign born employees.

When the above happens, which happens more often than many people would like to admit, all the above reasons come into effect: There is usually no rulebook on who gets promoted or specially rewarded and with which criteria, so the decision cannot be examined and the upper echelons of management can always produce another BS excuse (section B). Similarly if someone complains then she will also be on the spotlight for complaining, ending up to a far worse position than just not being promoted (section E). The companies do not want to improve or fix themselves, the machine cannot stop because a person got upset (section D), people are just asked to move on.


## Why is that and why I am honestly very happy to be here

The whole post is very opinionated in any case. From now on it is 100% opinionated and personal.

I believe that the so called London zone has an entrenched culture of wealth appreciation/extraction not wealth generation. You come with a specific skill set and the whole system is geared towards utilising them as much as possible, but not allowing you to acquire new or invest.

Second on the 

I have seen it in many different companies in the London zone including the ones I have worked
for. You enter for a junior or senior but not very high position and you see that the ratio
of nationalities of the people follows more or less the UK average. For IT and developers it is
usually people from the Indian subcontinent or Europe's South. While you observe the hierarchy
you see that somehow thesepeople are progressively excluded. The higher echelons look somehow
reserved for locals and possibly second generation immigrants or people with mixed origins. I have
observed it so often that now I can confidently say that there is a glass wall. Another term I heard
recently is called "unequal representation".



I believe the existence of glass walls is where all the arguments come together and also the
ultimate chicken and egg situation. Eventually I found myself being measured against criteria
that I could never adopt or even understand created a situation of facing a glass wall: you
can go so far until you end up in a place where you have to interface a lot with people
that have a completely different set of expectations from you and also are not willing to discuss
it.

Notes:

1. Initial title was about "British" companies, but after some research it seems that some of the stuff mentioned are more specific to the London zone. Then I read some articles/posts mentioning that this is a European thing. Having never worked outside Greater London within UK, I settled on the current title. If you think this is applies to other places please get in touch.
2. The diagrams are inspired from "LINK TO BUSINESS INSIDER ARTICLE AND TITLE", but not exactly the same.
3. The stories are a mix of different ones hence fictional but with actual experiences as structural elements. They have also been trimmed to get faster to the point and also the names are random.
4. Note that the term "client/server" is mostly used. This is an example of applying political correctness to language, on which we will return in a subsequent post.
5. Wanted to add it to her CV as an achievement.

*I think living in any alien culture for any length of time teaches you one very valuable lesson - that your own experience of the world is severely limited, and that there are millions of other people out there living their lives quite successfully in ways that are utterly different to your own.  It gives you a solid grounding in diversity as a fact of life and - unless you recoil into a defensive xenophobic chauvinism -  it teaches you the value of pluralism.  You're never going to be able to go back to your own culture and look at it the same way again.  You'll see flaws that weren't apparent before, and better ways of doing things that other cultures can offer.  (Of course, it's also important to be able to apply that in reverse - to see clearly where there are things your own culture does do better and which the culture you're working in lacks; you can't become one of these breast-beating knee-jerk anti-West wankers!)  Having that breadth of vision is deeply liberating, and it sharpens you at all sorts if levels if you let it.*

## A. Communication on a need to know basis

Suppose we have two teams that need to work together, the green and the orange. The most common pattern of interaction that I have observed is the "I say you do" one where someone, the green team for our example requests things to be done. The other part can usually only only acknowledge.

FIRST DIAGRAM HERE.

I have been educated in a different way where there is a lot of interaction among teams and their representatives. The first interactions should be dedicated for that discovery process, consisting mostly of questions and answers about what people do and how they see things. The boundaries of communication are a little bit fuzzy and while trying to fulfil the "requirements" of your internal or external clients there is a parallel dialogue going on from which you are trying to get insights on their deeper needs and motivations. Similarly they do the same thing with you. Depicted somehow like this:

SECOND DIAGRAM HERE.

The interaction can possibly progress becoming an "insight".

SECOND DIAGRAM HERE.

I think the unidirectional communication pattern is maybe the strongest factor for my issues and also for parts of the industry in general. For example how would an "orange" person here have an insight on what a client really needs if a "green" person is in a client facing role. The answer is that he cannot and probably with that mentallity he should not either.

Before following to the next section allow two stories related mostly with me following the second communication and interaction style in places that only knew the first. Feel free to
skip to (B). if not that much interested. The experiences are not real but a mash-up of very different places and people. None have happened to me but each individual element has.

### Why we are paying you

Sitting in a meeting room with Rachel, responsible for marketing. Last week the marketing department had air a TV advertisement which caused a spike of usage on company's web site. At the same time there were scheduled deployments running so the site visitors had some blips. This was the set-up, the conversation went somehow like this:

**Rachel**: We will air more TV advertisements in the following weeks in those dates, will that be OK?
**Me**: Sure, can I ask why did we choose to go on TV?
**Rachel**: (ignores the question) It will be next Friday, Monday the 5th and then we will get feedback from sales to see how and when to schedule more.
... conversation continues ...
**Me**: Can I ask why air a TV advertisement? You didn't answer before...
**Rachel**: Listen (pause), we (imperial "we") are paying you to work on the web side, how we advertise is my responsibility and it is not your job to ask how we advertise.

I was approaching the whole situation as a pure technical issue: is it an one off (so I should increase capacity temporarily) or a thing that will be persist (I should look for a more permanent solution)? Is it because *"our targeted demographic is in their 40s and 50s in a not so Internet savvy region"* so I should be more careful on not using technical terms on the copies and also remind the copy writer? If I am not allowed to get an insight on how Rachel thinks, how can I empathise with her or what she wants to achieve so that I can make small decisions without asking her? Also: who said that not answering pretending that the question was not even said is an appropriate polite way to defer it? Because your parents did that to you when you were a kid somehow legitimises it? What would go wrong if an IT guy knew how marketing decisions where made?

### English need improvement

A funny story in retrospect. My line manager at a scheduled performance review informed me in an meeting that a person that I was working him told him to communicate to me that "I needed to improve my English". I am really interested in my communication skills so I asked for specifics, is it my kangaroo accent, something else?

Then the line manager asked me to wait five minutes got out and came back. There was the following comment he was told from the other person: *"Dimitrios is asking so many questions, I do not know what is wrong just cannot understand why he doesn't get what he needs to do on the first time"*. I should just execute whatever was communicated. My probing for context and additional information could only be a result of not getting it right for the first time. Wow, really?


## B. Master/Slave not Peer to Peer

Borrowing from computer systems architecture, another way to frame the same argument would be a "*peer to peer*" compared against say a "*master/slave*" (4) approach. In a peer to peer setting, top level management sets priorities and targets, internal rules as well as curates the business culture. It is up to the different departments, the peers, to fulfil their mission acting in the best interests of the organisation. Different departments and people have their own **relative importance**, needs and targets within the the organization's boundaries.

In a "*master/slave*" environment there is a documented or implied hierarchy. People on the "master" side dictate to the ones on the "client" what to do, without any need for justification or options. Also there is no collaboration between departments, only a respect to that hierarchy. Between business functions or teams the relationship cannot be anything else but **binary**. Politeness is utilised for sugar-coating purposes. I am referring to the very well documented "*could you please have this report ready by 16:00?*", which is not a question, there is no please and 16:00 is not something to be debated. When you are on the "master" side whatever you say must be fulfilled and the way you want to, if you are on the "slave" side your purpose is to obey.

Something that makes things worse in my profession is that even in technology oriented companies, IT is always on the "slave" side.

Two observations related to the *master/slave* model is the existence of Chinese whispers and the malevolence attached to the "c-word". Some more thoughts follow, while the skimming reader might prefer to jump to section C.


### It is better to say yes and do it wrong than talk and do it right

After discussing the above with many people as well as some self reflection to previous experiences,
it seems that it is far better to do the wrong thing and iterate then try to do something right
the first time.

When you are in the room gathering requirements, you are allowed to ask as little as possible or
even better nothing. What is important is to say "yes" to your master. Then you can go back to
your desk, play chinese wishpers with your subordinates and produce somehow an artifact based on
your understanding of his master's voice. Then you display the output of your work and receive
some feedback: "I meant this", "it looks to me more that we should do that", etc. Then rinse and
repeat.

Eventually though with much more resources and effort a final result which is what the master
wanted will be reached, moreover what is the important factor is that whenever there was a meeting
you reached the saying yes point very fast, you are such a good slave. What people like me did
not understand is that your "master" here is probably "slave" to someone else. He did not even bother
acquiring as much information or understanding of the situation because he did not wanted to disrupt
this chain of relationships. This behaviour is the fabric of the whole system.

In my world, and it seems that it is the world of also the USA based companies (which remember in
IT are doing better than the UK ones so they are "right"), talent and time are scarce resources.
Asking questions, empathising and getting insights will speed-up those feedback loops. It is OK
not to know something and leave it up for later or even use the output of an iteration as a basis
for a future conversation. On top it is OK to say that "there is not enough information at this
point so we cannot start anything". The master can be sad in the present as long as  him or the
company can be happy in the future.

What's my current approach

Some years before a good friend of mine became acquainted with a strict Muslim guy that was working on the same company as him. Our friend used to say no to all invitations to go to the pub or to eat out full English breakfasts. He was very polite and friendly but somehow distant. At some point my friend asked him about his lifestyle and he got an interesting response: "I basically live in an enclave, I spend my weekend with my family doing our own thing, I interface with the society as much as is needed. I enjoy the freedoms and the services that the British system provides, I pay my taxes and obey the law. It's OK". When I had heard that I was puzzled and almost annoyed: how can you self impose a throttle on how much you interface. Can't you have a drink... once? Now I became that guy with regards to the business culture. I am trying to insulate myself from the mentallities of the UK businesses that I disagree with. It seems that many times a mix and match approach is accepted. As that guy said: "It's OK".

The worst question that you can ask

The worst question that you can ask by far is the following: "With which criteria did you select the employee of the month?". This will trigger a metal meltdown and a 
cluster-crack (politeness) in a thousand different levels. Let's first read the story of a friend who commited this sin and then let's
analyse the why's and hows.

Luciana was working as a waiter in a busy big touristy pub somewhere up London's north. There were about 10 to 15 waiters and waitresses from
differrent nationalities and different levels of engagement. For some of them it was a job for some others it was the visa, some of them
wanted to continue working on the same industry some others saw it as a transitional phase while finishing their studies. Life was perfect for
our little foreign friend until one day on the staff meeting the establishment's manager announced something similar to this: "From now on
we will have the employee of the month, and for the first month I decided that this would be Jessica". Our heroine without much thought asked
in front of everybody: "Can I ask with which criteria you chose Jessica? What makes her better than the rest?". At that point the manager
did not answer for just a little bit of time that projected that he was feeling uncomfortable then answered: "I am not willing to disclose them
at the point, but will get back to it next month". The story as you might have guessed did not end up there.

In a couple of week's the door of the freezer was not closed properly leaving cold air flowing out. For some reason some of the stuff were passing
off from that point without observing it and trying to close it or alternatively they did not care. When Luciana passed without closing it, she
was called to the manager's office. With an angry demanding voice: "I can see from the camera footage that you did not close the door of the
fridge, can I ask why is that?", showing footage in rewind/play mode. The answer was with another question: "Can you put the video back 30 more seconds?",
bollowed by "I now see three more employes not closing the door. Can I ask you why none of them is here but me?". As I've heard from the narator
the next two lines were: "But I am asking you" followed by "... and I am asking you". Fast forward to the end of the story: Jessica had still
her photo as employee of the month for the next three months. Then the frame was removed without any subsequent employees ever again.

What has gone wrong here, which I have also observed and lived in some of the places I have been: First there is the pattern of behaviour "you ask something-
I am not answering you pretending everything is OK- I get back to you on something random in the near future - you have to deduce that it is about that
thing that happened two weeks before, yes when I did not speak and pretended it was OK". I do not know who instilled it into UK's business culture nor if
it happens elsewhere. This is what happened to Luciana in our story. She didn't think that what she did was wrong. When the "boss" got back she didn't
make the connection - "Ahh it's about that thing that he looked at me funny and didn't talk", so she continued the discussion pushing him - "why me"
treating the incident in isolation.

The other element that has been discussed elsewhere here is that the higher echelons of management should not feel the need to provide transparency or
rationale to the lower ones. "Jessica is the employee of the month because I said so". The plebs job is to obey, in that case they should cheer and
clap their hands, not challenge the decision nor tell me what to do. I think these requests are the cardinal sin for such environments: the pleb 
is rising to the level of the boss: "tell me how to make decisions" and also claiming that they have a saying in how these are made "Why Jessica not me?".
Our foreign friends question felt like insulting too many taboos at once.

The las thing is that the people that tend to get upraised/promoted without any justification are usually locals or cronies of the boss, something
that shouldn't be a surprise really. This might instil a self fulfilling prophecy to the rest of the employees: The man will never award me
because I am a foreigner/minority/whatever so they will not work more/better etc so once this kicks off the person doing this will not be eligible
for promotion/appraisal anyway.
