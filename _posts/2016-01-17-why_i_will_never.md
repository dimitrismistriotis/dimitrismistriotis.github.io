# Why I will never work again for a London-type company (1)

Decided to write these posts after this recent experience: I sit in a small meeting room of the US-based multinational for which I am currently employed doors locked, facing a video screen on which my current manager summarises the latest appraisal and the changes that it will bring to my financial situation. The summary ends with three reasons on why my performance has been good. Suddenly my mind plays a nasty deja-vu trick and transports me to a very similar situation three to four years before in a meeting room similar to the one I am sitting right now belonging to a UK-based employer with my then line manager reading from a printer paper why I am not doing good and need improvement. The deja-vu tinkers with my head because in both cases the rational was exactly the same but with the exact opposite outcome!

The story continues with my current manager staring at the emotional blankness
of my face asking me if I am OK and why I don't
look as happy as I am supposed to. I decided to tell him that I have been so surprised by the news that I am speechless. Something not far from the truth but for two competing reasons as at the back of my head I have two different thoughts fighting like that little angel and devil from those vintage cartoons. One shouts: "Be happy, party, and forget everything else" the other screams: "Write about it, process it and let people know". Somehow they both won.

**Disclaimer**: This is not an aphorism of the current culture nor a polemic, I would not treat it
as a criticism either. What this essay tries to be is a reflection of the culture that I have
encountered, emphasis on the bad parts - blame human nature - and why I believe that I cannot be
part of it or say it in another way, why as a first generation immigrant I cannot fully assimilate.
Whenever we need answers we turn to the arts, the more appropriate quote I found is from an author
that had lived extensively abroad. Richard K. Morgan's aspect is as follows:

*I think living in any alien culture for any length of time teaches you one very valuable lesson - that your own experience of the world is severely limited, and that there are millions of other people out there living their lives quite successfully in ways that are utterly different to your own.  It gives you a solid grounding in diversity as a fact of life and - unless you recoil into a defensive xenophobic chauvinism -  it teaches you the value of pluralism.  You're never going to be able to go back to your own culture and look at it the same way again.  You'll see flaws that weren't apparent before, and better ways of doing things that other cultures can offer.  (Of course, it's also important to be able to apply that in reverse - to see clearly where there are things your own culture does do better and which the culture you're working in lacks; you can't become one of these breast-beating knee-jerk anti-West wankers!)  Having that breadth of vision is deeply liberating, and it sharpens you at all sorts if levels if you let it.*

If I had to picture the factors behind my rationale I would think of a diagram with overlapping
circles something similar to this one:

DIAGRAM HERE

Generally it has to do with the following:

* A. Communication between departments
* B. Master - slave relationships when they collaborate internally and externally
* C. Excellence intolerance.
* D. Local baggage to a supposedly international environment - class mentality, other behaviours.
* Too much reliant on how "the City"/financial sector operates even for industries that are inherently (fixed mentality).
* Absence of rules and transparency - just obey
* Preserving the status quo trumps efficiency (or everything else really)
* People not believing things can be different or even better
* Imperial arrogance without the imperium/empire
* Glass walls for foreigners and unequal representation

I will explain how I have experienced each one of them and how each interacts
or overlaps with another. With the exception of some stories that I wanted to get out of my head,
I will try to be brief because the list is extensive. If anyone of you, my readers wants an
expansion or more information on a specific subjects, please say so and I will write something for
you, even if you are the only person requesting it. If you believe that your organisation or company
suffers from some of the above and needs help getting out, get in touch. I will do something
very English, I will charge you.

## A. Communication between departments

Suppose we have two teams that need to work together, the green and the orange. The most common pattern of interaction that I have observed is the "I say you do" one where someone, the green team for our example requests things to be done. The other part can usually only only acknowledge.

FIRST DIAGRAM HERE.

I have been educated in a different way where there is a lot of interaction among teams and their representatives. The first interactions should be dedicated for that discovery process, consisting mostly of questions and answers about what people do and how they see things. The boundaries of communication are a little bit fuzzy and while trying to fulfil the "requirements" of your internal or external clients there is a parallel dialogue going on from which you are trying to get insights on their deeper needs and motivations. Similarly they do the same thing with you. Depicted somehow like this:

SECOND DIAGRAM HERE.

The interaction can possibly progress becoming an "insight".

SECOND DIAGRAM HERE.

I think the unidirectional communication pattern is maybe the strongest factor for my issues and also for parts of the industry in general. For example how would an "orange" person here have an insight on what a client really needs if a "green" person is in a client facing role. The answer is that he cannot and probably with that mentallity he should not either.

Before following to the next section allow two stories related mostly with me following the second communication and interaction style in places that only knew the first. Feel free to
skip to (B). if not that much interested. The experiences are not real but a mash-up of very different places and people. None have happened to me but each individual element has.

### Why we are paying you

Sitting in a meeting room with Rachel, responsibl marketing. Last week the marketing department had air a TV advertisement which caused a spike of usage on company's web site. At the same time there were scheduled delpoyments running so the site visitors had some blips. This was the setup, the conversation went somehow like this:

**Rachel**: We will air more TV advertisements in the following weeks in those dates, will that be OK?
**Me**: Sure, can I ask why did we choose to go on TV?
**Rachel**: (ignores the question) It will be next Friday, Monday the 5th and then we will get feedback from sales to see how and when to schedule more.
... conversation continues ...
**Me**: Can I ask why air a TV advertisement? You didn't answer before...
**Rachel**: Listen (pause), we (imperial "we") are paying you to work on the web side, how we advertise is my responsibility and it is not your job to ask how we advertise.

I was approaching the whole situation as a pure technical issue: is it an one off (so I should increase capacity temporarily) or a thing that will be persist (I should look for a more permanent solution)? Is it because *"our targeted demographic is in their 40s and 50s in a not so Internet savvy region"* so I should be more careful on not using technical terms on the copies and also remind the copy writer? If I am not allowed to get an insight on how Rachel thinks, how can I empathise with her or what she wants to achieve so that I can make small decisions without asking her? Also: who said that not answering pretendind that the question was not even said is an appropriate polite way to deffer it? Because your parents did that to you when you were a kid somehow legitimises it? What would go wrong if an IT guy knew how marketing decisions where made?

### English need improvement

A funny story in retrospect. My line manager at a scheduled performance review informed me in an meeting that a person that I was working him told him to communicate to me that "I needed to improve my English". I am really interested in my communication skills so I asked for specifics, is it my kangaroo accent, something else?

Then the line manager asked me to wait five minutes got out and came back. There was the following comment he was told from the other person: *"Dimitrios is asking so many questions, I do not know what is wrong just cannot understand why he doesn't get what he needs to do on the first time"*. I should just execute whatever was communicated. My probing for context and additional information could only be a result of not getting it right for the first time. Wow, really?

## B. Peer to Peer versus Master/Slave

Borrowing from computer systems architecture, another way to frame the same argument would be a "*peer to peer*" compared against say a "*master/slave*" (4) approach. In a peer to peer setting, top level management sets priorities and targets, internal rules as well as curates the business culture. It is up to the different departments, the peers, to fulfil their mission acting in the best interests of the organisation. Different departments and people have their own **relative importance**, needs and targets within the the organization's boundaries.

In a "*master/slave*" environment there is a documented or implied hierarchy. People on the "master" side dictate to the ones on the "client" what to do, without any need for justification or options. Also there is no collaboration between departments, only a respect to that hierarchy. Between business functions or teams the relationship cannot be anything else but **binary**. Politeness is utilised for sugar-coating purposes. I am referring to the very well documented "*could you please have this report ready by 16:00?*", which is not a question, there is no please and 16:00 is not something to be debated. When you are on the "master" side whatever you say must be fulfilled and the way you want to, if you are on the "slave" side your purpose is to obey.

Something that makes things worse in my profession is that even in technology oriented companies, IT is always on the "slave" side.

Two observations related to the *master/slave* model is the existence of Chinese whispers and the malevolence attached to the "c-word". Some more thoughts follow, while the skimming reader might prefer to jump to section C.


### It is better to say yes and do it wrong than talk and do it right

After discussing the above with many people as well as some self reflection to previous experiences,
it seems that it is far better to do the wrong thing and iterate then try to do something right
the first time.

When you are in the room gathering requirements, you are allowed to ask as little as possible or
even better nothing. What is important is to say "yes" to your master. Then you can go back to
your desk, play chinese wishpers with your subordinates and produce somehow an artifact based on
your understanding of his master's voice. Then you display the output of your work and receive
some feedback: "I meant this", "it looks to me more that we should do that", etc. Then rinse and
repeat.

Eventually though with much more resources and effort a final result which is what the master
wanted will be reached, moreover what is the important factor is that whenever there was a meeting
you reached the saying yes point very fast, you are such a good slave. What people like me did
not understand is that your "master" here is probably "slave" to someone else. He did not even bother
acquiring as much information or understanding of the situation because he did not wanted to disrupt
this chain of relationships. This behaviour is the fabric of the whole system.

In my world, and it seems that it is the world of also the USA based companes (which remember in
IT are doing bettter than the UK ones so they are "right"), talent and time are scarse resources.
Asking questions, empathising and getting insights will speedup those feedback loops. It is OK
not to know something and leave it up for later or even use the output of an itteration as a basis
for a future conversation. On top it is OK to say that "there is not enough information at this
point so we cannot start anything". The master can be sad in the present as long as  him or the
company can be happy in the future.

## C. Excellence intolerance.

I was trying to get to a striking pictorial to explain this, until luckily I stumbled to a diagram
similar to this:

flawed/or not developed yet --> works without flaws / "bugs" --> Excellent

## On glass walls

I have seen it in many different companies in the London zone including the ones I have worked
for. You enter for a junior or senior but not very high position and you see that the ratio
of nationalities of the people follows more or less the UK average. For IT and developers it is
usually people from the Indian subcontinent or Europe's South. While you observe the hierarchy
you see that somehow these people are progressively excluded. The higher echelons look somehow
reserved for locals and possibly second generation immigrants or people with mixed origins. I have
observed it so often that now I can confidently say that there is a glass wall. Another term I heard
recently is called "unequal representation".

I believe the existence of glass walls is where all the arguments come together and also the
ultimate chichen and egg situation. Eventually I found myself being measured against criteria
that I could never adopt or even understand created a situation of facing a glass wall: you
can go so far until you end up in a place where you have to interface a lot with people
that have a completely different set of expectations from you and also are not willing to discuss
it.

Notes:

1. Initial title was about "British" companies, but after some research it seems that some of the stuff mentioned are more specific to the London zone. Having never worked outside Greater London and being conservative, settled on the current title.
2. The diagrams are inspired from "LINK TO BUSINESS INSIDER ARTICLE AND TITLE", but not exactly the same.
3. The stories are a mix of different ones hence fictional but with actual experiences as structural elements. They have also been trimmed to get faster to the point and also the names are random.
4. Note that the term "client/server" is mostly used. This is an example of applying political correctness to language, on which we will return in a subsequent post.
5. Wanted to add it to her CV as an achievement.

What's my current approach

Some years before a good friend of mine became acquainted with a strict Muslim guy that was working on the same company as him. Our friend used to say no to all invitations to go to the pub or to eat out full English breakfasts. He was very polite and friendly but somehow distant. At some point my friend asked him about his lifestyle and he got an interesting response: "I basically live in an enclave, I spend my weekend with my family doing our own thing, I interface with the society as much as is needed. I enjoy the freedoms and the services that the British system provides, I pay my taxes and obey the law. It's OK". When I had heard that I was puzzled and almost annoyed: how can you self impose a throttle on how much you interface. Can't you have a drink... once? Now I became that guy with regards to the business culture. I am trying to insulate myself from the mentallities of the UK businesses that I disagree with. It seems that many times a mix and match approach is accepted. As that guy said: "It's OK".

The worst question that you can ask

The worst question that you can ask by far is the following: "With which criteria did you select the employee of the month?". This will trigger a metal meltdown and a 
cluster-crack (politeness) in a thousand different levels. Let's first read the story of a friend who commited this sin and then let's
analyse the why's and hows.

Luciana was working as a waiter in a busy big touristy pub somewhere up London's north. There were about 10 to 15 waiters and waitresses from
differrent nationalities and different levels of engagement. For some of them it was a job for some others it was the visa, some of them
wanted to continue working on the same industry some others saw it as a transitional phase while finishing their studies. Life was perfect for
our little foreign friend until one day on the staff meeting the establishment's manager announced something similar to this: "From now on
we will have the employee of the month, and for the first month I decided that this would be Jessica". Our heroine without much thought asked
in front of everybody: "Can I ask with which criteria you chose Jessica? What makes her better than the rest?". At that point the manager
did not answer for just a little bit of time that projected that he was feeling uncomfortable then answered: "I am not willing to disclose them
at the point, but will get back to it next month". The story as you might have guessed did not end up there.

In a couple of week's the door of the freezer was not closed properly leaving cold air flowing out. For some reason some of the stuff were passing
off from that point without observing it and trying to close it or alternatively they did not care. When Luciana passed without closing it, she
was called to the manager's office. With an angry demanding voice: "I can see from the camera footage that you did not close the door of the
fridge, can I ask why is that?", showing footage in rewind/play mode. The answer was with another question: "Can you put the video back 30 more seconds?",
bollowed by "I now see three more employes not closing the door. Can I ask you why none of them is here but me?". As I've heard from the narator
the next two lines were: "But I am asking you" followed by "... and I am asking you". Fast forward to the end of the story: Jessica had still
her photo as employee of the month for the next three months. Then the frame was removed without any subsequent employees ever again.

What has gone wrong here, which I have also observed and lived in some of the places I have been: First there is the pattern of behaviour "you ask something-
I am not answering you pretending everything is OK- I get back to you on something random in the near future - you have to deduce that it is about that
thing that happened two weeks before, yes when I did not speak and pretended it was OK". I do not know who instilled it into UK's business culture nor if
it happens elsewhere. This is what happened to Luciana in our story. She didn't think that what she did was wrong. When the "boss" got back she didn't
make the connection - "Ahh it's about that thing that he looked at me funny and didn't talk", so she continued the discussion pushing him - "why me"
treating the incident in isolation.

The other element that has been discussed elsewhere here is that the higher echelons of management should not feel the need to provide transparency or
rationale to the lower ones. "Jessica is the employee of the month because I said so". The plebs job is to obey, in that case they should cheer and
clap their hands, not challenge the decission nor tell me what to do. I think these requests are the cardinal sin for such environmnents: the pleb 
is rising to the level of the boss: "tell me how to make decisions" and also claiming that they have a saying in how these are made "Why Jessica not me?".
Our foreign friends question felt like insulting too many taboos at once.

The las thing is that the people that tend to get upraised/promoted without any justification are usually locals or chronies of the boss, something
that shouldn't be a surprise really. This might instill a self fulfilling prophecy to the rest of the employees: The man will never award me
because I am a foreigner/minority/whatever so they will not work more/better etc so once this kicks off the person doing this will not be eliigible
for promotion/appraisal anyway.
