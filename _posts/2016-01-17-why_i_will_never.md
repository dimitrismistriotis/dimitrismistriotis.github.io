# Why I will never work again for a British company (1)

It starts with a story: I am sitting in a small meeting room of the US-based multinational for which I currently work facing a video screen, doors locked while my current manager summarises the latest appraisal and what will change to my financial situation. The summary ends with three reasons on why my performance has been good. Suddenly my mind plays a nasty deja-vu trick and transports me to a very similar situation three years before in a meeting room similar to the one I am sitting right now but on a UK-based employer with my then line manager reading from a printer paper why I am not doing good and need improvement. The deja-vu tinkers with my head because in both cases the reasons are exactly the same with only the order different!

The story continues with my current manager asking me if I am OK and why I don't look happy. I decided to tell him that I had been happy when he broke the news and was concerned on how to keep up and improve. At the back of my head I have two different thoughts fighting like that little angel and devil from those vintage cartoons. The one shouts: "Be happy and party" the other one screams: "Write about it, process it and let people know". They both won.

The reasons that make me currently unsuitable for most UK minded, not necessary UK based employers as I have experienced in the last seven years working here but also from discussions with many people are:

* Interfacing,
* Desire for excellence, customer satisfaction,
* Improper approach to being international,
* Glass walls (that kind of make sense),
* NEXT ONES HERE OR REMOVE THIS LINE.

## Interfacing

Let's start with one of the reasons stated above. get to the differentiating reasons but first an insight on how I process/treat my "work" (2).

Suppose we have two teams that need to work together, the green and the orange. The most common pattern of interaction that I have observed is the "I say you do" one where someone acting as a client/master requests things to be done and the other one can usually only acknowledge.

FIRST DIAGRAM HERE.

I have been educated in a more interactive way where there is a lot of interaction between teams and people representing them. The first interactions should be dedicated for that discovery process, consisting mostly of questions and answers about what people do and how they see things. The boundaries of communication are a little bit fuzzy and while trying to fulfil the "requirements" of your internal or external clients there is a parallel dialogue going on from which you are trying to get insights on their deeper needs and motivation and similarly them from you.

The interaction can possibly progress becoming an "insight".

Here are some anecdotes from following the second way with people following the first.

### Why we are paying you

Sitting in a meeting room with Rachel, head of marketing. Last week the marketing department had air a TV advertisement which caused a spike of usage. The fact that at the same time there were deployment scripts running, stopping the service for a some time made the situation worse. The conversation went somehow like this:

**Rachel**: We will air more TV advertisements in the following weeks in those dates, will that be OK?
**Me**: Sure, can I ask why did we choose to go on TV?
**Rachel**: (ignores the question) It will be next Friday, Monday the 5th and then we will get feedback from sales to see how and when to schedule more.
... conversation continues ...
**Me**: Can I ask again about why air a TV advertisement? You didn't answer before...
**Rachel**: Listen, we (imperial "we") are paying you to work on the web side, how we advertise is my responsibility and it is not your job to ask how we advertise.

Of course I was approaching the whole situation as a pure technical issue: is it an one off (so I should increase capacity temporarily) or a thing that will be persist (I should look for a more permanent solution)? Is it because *"our targeted demographic is in their 40s and 50s in a not so Internet savvy region"* so I should be more careful on not using technical terms on the copies and also remind the copy writer? If I am not allowed to get an insight on how Rachel thinks, how can I empathise with her or what she wants to achieve so that I can make small decisions without asking her?

### Needs improvement

A funny story in retrospect happened when a line manager informed me in an meeting that a person that I was working him told him to communicate to me that "I needed to improve my English". While asking for specifics, like what should be particularly improved, there was the following comment: *"Dimitrios is asking so many questions, I do not know what is wrong just cannot understand why he doesn't get what he needs to do on the first time"*. So I should just execute whatever was communicated no questions asked and the only way someone would ask something would be because... he didn't get it the first time.

Notes:

1. Extravagant title aiming to grab attention the proper one is: *"Why I am not inclined to pursue future employment to a company of British origin"*.
2. The diagrams are inspired from "LINK TO BUSINESS INSIDER ARTICLE AND TITLE", but not exactly the same.
3. The stories are a mix of different ones hence fictional but with actual experiences as structural elements. They have also been trimmed to get faster to the point and also the names are random.
