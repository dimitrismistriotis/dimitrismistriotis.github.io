# Why I will never work again for a London-type company (1)

Decided to write these posts after this recent experience: I sit in a small meeting room of the US-based multinational for which I am currently employed doors locked, facing a video screen on which my current manager summarises the latest appraisal and the changes that it will bring to my financial situation. The summary ends with three reasons on why my performance has been good. Suddenly my mind plays a nasty deja-vu trick and transports me to a very similar situation three to four years before in a meeting room similar to the one I am sitting right now belonging to a UK-based employer with my then line manager reading from a printer paper why I am not doing good and need improvement. The deja-vu tinkers with my head because in both cases the rational was exactly the same but with the exact opposite outcome!

The story continues with my current manager asking me if I am OK and why I don't look happy. I decided to tell him that I have been so surprised by the news that I am speechless. Something not far from the truth but for two competing reasons as at the back of my head I have two different thoughts fighting like that little angel and devil from those vintage cartoons. One shouts: "Be happy and party" the other screams: "Write about it, process it and let people know". They both won.

## Interfacing

Let's start with one of the reasons stated above. get to the differentiating reasons but first an insight on how I process/treat my "work" (2).

Suppose we have two teams that need to work together, the green and the orange. The most common pattern of interaction that I have observed is the "I say you do" one where someone acting as a client/master requests things to be done and the other one can usually only acknowledge.

FIRST DIAGRAM HERE.

I have been educated in a more interactive way where there is a lot of interaction among teams and their representatives. The first interactions should be dedicated for that discovery process, consisting mostly of questions and answers about what people do and how they see things. The boundaries of communication are a little bit fuzzy and while trying to fulfil the "requirements" of your internal or external clients there is a parallel dialogue going on from which you are trying to get insights on their deeper needs and motivation and similarly them from you.

SECOND DIAGRAM HERE.

The interaction can possibly progress becoming an "insight".

SECOND DIAGRAM HERE.

Here are some anecdotes from following the second way with people following the first.

### Why we are paying you

Sitting in a meeting room with Rachel, head of marketing. Last week the marketing department had air a TV advertisement which caused a spike of usage. The fact that at the same time there were deployment scripts running, stopping the service for a some time made the situation worse. The conversation went somehow like this:

**Rachel**: We will air more TV advertisements in the following weeks in those dates, will that be OK?
**Me**: Sure, can I ask why did we choose to go on TV?
**Rachel**: (ignores the question) It will be next Friday, Monday the 5th and then we will get feedback from sales to see how and when to schedule more.
... conversation continues ...
**Me**: Can I ask again about why air a TV advertisement? You didn't answer before...
**Rachel**: Listen, we (imperial "we") are paying you to work on the web side, how we advertise is my responsibility and it is not your job to ask how we advertise.

Of course I was approaching the whole situation as a pure technical issue: is it an one off (so I should increase capacity temporarily) or a thing that will be persist (I should look for a more permanent solution)? Is it because *"our targeted demographic is in their 40s and 50s in a not so Internet savvy region"* so I should be more careful on not using technical terms on the copies and also remind the copy writer? If I am not allowed to get an insight on how Rachel thinks, how can I empathise with her or what she wants to achieve so that I can make small decisions without asking her?

### Needs improvement

A funny story in retrospect happened when a line manager informed me in an meeting that a person that I was working him told him to communicate to me that "I needed to improve my English". While asking for specifics, like what should be particularly improved, there was the following comment: *"Dimitrios is asking so many questions, I do not know what is wrong just cannot understand why he doesn't get what he needs to do on the first time"*. So I should just execute whatever was communicated no questions asked and the only way someone would ask something would be because... he didn't get it the first time.

## Peer to Peer versus Master/Slave

Borrowing from computer systems architecture, another way to frame the same argument would be a "peer to peer" versus a "master/slave" (4) approach. In a peer to peer company, the management sets priorities and targets, internal rules as well as manages the business culture. It is up to the different departments, the peers, to fulfil the above acting in the best interests of the organisation. Different departments and people have their own **relative importance**, needs and targets within the the organization.

In a "master/slave" environment the people on the "master" side dictate to the "client" ones what to do. Between those two the relationship cannot be anything but **binary** maybe with some politeness as icing on top for sugar-coating purposes. When you are on the "master" side whatever you say must be more or less be implemented, on the "slave" side you can more or less obey - no middle ground. To make matters worse even in technology related companies IT is always on the "slave" side.

There was the experience with the communications revamp: The development team was in the last phases of a refactoring that had the introduction of some significant functionality as a by-product and a specific technology for which that girl, let's call her Aruna was interested in (5). At that point people from customer service ~~asked~~ ordered us to do yet another re-write of the email communication to our users because "important client X said so". To our pleas for pushing it back for a week so that we could finish what we were doing, moreover as it had been pushed back more than once, we got a display of power: we say you do, STFU in between and move on "please". Even the argument that the refactoring would be further delayed because of the context switch fell to deaf ears: "No we can inject additional work and the schedule remains the same". The story ended with our friend Aruna starting to update her CV and leaving the company in two months after the incident to greener pastures. The injected stuff was half baked because it just did not fit the flow, "big client X" did not end up happy. Rafactoring got severely cut down. COmpany suffered but at least the master/slave model preserved thanks God.

Before further dive in to other observations two specific manifestations of the master/slave model: Chinese whispers and the "c-word" in the next post.

Notes:

1. Initial title was about "British" companies, but after some research it seems that some of the stuff mentioned are more specific to the London zone. Having never worked outside Greater London and being conservative, settled on the current title.
2. The diagrams are inspired from "LINK TO BUSINESS INSIDER ARTICLE AND TITLE", but not exactly the same.
3. The stories are a mix of different ones hence fictional but with actual experiences as structural elements. They have also been trimmed to get faster to the point and also the names are random.
4. Note that the term "client/server" is mostly used. This is an example of applying political correctness to language, on which we will return in a subsequent post.
5. Wanted to add it to her CV as an achievement.
