# Why I will never work again for a British company (1)

It starts with a story: I am sitting in a small meeting room of the US-based multinational for which I currently work facing a video screen, doors locked while my current manager summarises the latest appraisal and what will change to my financial situation. The summary ends with three reasons on why my performance has been good. Suddenly my mind plays a nasty deja-vu trick and transports me to a very similar situation three years before in a meeting room similar to the one I am sitting right now but on a UK-based employer with my then line manager reading from a printer paper why I am not doing good and need improvement. The deja-vu tinkers with my head because in both cases the reasons are exactly the same with only the order different!

The story continues with my current manager asking me if I am OK and why I don't look happy. I decided to tell him that I had been happy when he broke the news and was concerned on how to keep up and improve. At the back of my head I have two different thoughts fighting like that little angel and devil from those vintage cartoons. The one shouts: "Be happy and party" the other one screams: "Write about it, process it and let people know". They both won.

The reasons that make me currently unsuitable for most UK minded, not necessary UK based employers as I have experienced in the last seven years working here but also from discussions with many people are:

* Interfacing,
* Desire for excellence, customer satisfaction,
* Improper approach to being international,
* Glass walls - which kind of make sense,
* NEXT ONES HERE OR REMOVE THIS LINE.

## Interfacing

Let's start with one of the reasons stated above. get to the differentiating reasons but first an insight on how I process/treat my "work" (2).

Suppose we have two teams that need to work together, the green and the orange. The most common pattern of interaction that I have observed is the "I say you do" one where someone acting as a client/master requests things to be done and the other one can usually only acknowledge.

I have been educated in a more interactive way where there is a lot of interaction between teams and people representing them. The first interactions should be dedicated for that discovery process, consisting mostly of questions and answers about what people do and how they see things. The boundaries of communication are a little bit fuzzy and while trying to fulfil the "requirements" of your internal or external clients there is a parallel dialogue going on from which you are trying to get insights on their deeper needs and motivation and similarly them from you.

The interaction can possibly progress becoming an "insight".

Allow to revisit some experiences accumulated along my employment for UK based companies (3).

### He needs improvement

### Why we are paying you

Sitting in a meeting room with Rachel, head of marketing. Last week the marketing department had air a TV advertisement which caused a spike of usage. The fact that at the same time there were deployment scripts running, stopping the service for a some time made the situation worse. The conversation went somehow like this:

**Rachel**: We will air more TV advertisements in the following weeks in those dates, will that be OK?
**Me**: Sure, can I ask why did we choose to go on TV?
**Rachel**: (ignores my question) It will be next Friday, Monday the 5th and then we will get feedback from sales to see how and when to schedule more.

Notes:

1. Extravagant title aiming to grab attention the proper one is: *"Why I am not inclined to pursue future employment to a company of British origin"*.
2. The diagrams are inspired from "LINK TO BUSINESS INSIDER ARTICLE AND TITLE", but not exactly the same.
3. The stories are a mix of different ones hence fictional but with actual experiences as structural elements. They have also been trimmed to get faster to the point and also the names are random.
