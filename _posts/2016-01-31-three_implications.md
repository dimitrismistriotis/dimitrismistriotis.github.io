It becomes obvious that with such mentallity the people related with actual production of products or services are always the last ones in the chain. Deterministically it is impossible to create robust products or architectures, generic enough to serve a wider audience or something that would scale. The products reflect an accumulation patches originating from "yesses" to people irrelevant with technical issues that somehow need to be maintained.


There was the experience with the communications revamp: The development team was in the last phases of a refactoring that had the introduction of some significant functionality as a by-product and a specific technology for which that girl, let's call her Aruna was interested in (5). At that point people from customer service ~~asked~~ ordered us to do yet another re-write of the email communication to our users because "important client X said so". To our pleas for pushing it back for a week so that we could finish what we were doing, moreover as it had been pushed back more than once, we got a display of power: we say you do, STFU in between and move on "please". Even the argument that the refactoring would be further delayed because of the context switch fell to deaf ears: "No we can inject additional work and the schedule remains the same". The story ended with our friend Aruna starting to update her CV and leaving the company in two months after the incident to greener pastures. The injected stuff was half baked because it just did not fit the flow, "big client X" did not end up happy. Rafactoring got severely cut down. COmpany suffered but at least the master/slave model preserved thanks God.
