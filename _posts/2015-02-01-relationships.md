title: British business relationships
---

It might seem that I am ranting or just in a bad mood when writing posts like this,
or that I do not like London/UK. On the contrary, I do, just having lived here
for some years, I've started observing some patterns that were not initially
visible. Aim is to describe them and have them available to people that are
thinking on migrating and/or starting a business here or to start a discussion.

Thesis: British IT businesses treat business relationships with specific
partners as more important than the product, business culture or basically
everything else. This reflects internal business organisations and priorities,
leaving most of them ripe from disruption from US based businesses.

Let's start with education. I've observed two elements: a business education
mono-culture and something that seems like a projection of the class system.
In detail, I've attended three business seminars while living in London from
different institutions. In two of them, the third was strictly startup oriented,
we got trained to aim for the highest margins. At one attendants were presented
with a Maslow's pyramid on which the bottom was raw materials (lowest margin),
climbing to utilities, services up to specific needs which had the highest margin.
Discussing on high margin vs high volume everybody seemd to agree that it's more
preferable to sell on high margin and build a relationship with the client.
First time that this happened, Ι brought up businesses such as Amazon, Google,
Paypal. Where's the high margin in those. The answer of course was that I was
brining up "exceptions". Allow me to elaborate more on that later in this
article.

## Foundations

Mostly from disucussions with different people it seems that this is what most
UK based business schools and universities tend to teach. So most strategists
and executives are trained to spot the "high margin" in a business model that
they investigate or is suggested to them. Being a small enough country to
support two approaches on pretty much everything, I've stated to believe that
there is some sort of mono-culture. Anectodal all of the above, but cannot let
go that always while presenting a business plan or a product, there is always
someone in the audience asking: Can you build a customised version for "XYZ"?
If "ABC" comes and asks for "D" would you implement it only for them?

The other factor that has been observed is a projection of the class system in
the decision making process. It seems that there is a "serve the richest person
in the room" culture around. It's a delicate issue to discuss since people are
heavily opinionated about it and associate it with politics, but it sometimes
feels like an elephant in the room so it has to be brought up. There is that
tendency to try to create a cash flow creating a customised service to the
biggest brand name, an important client. For example if you are creating a
system for say retail/super markets then you'd better have Tesco, Sainsbury's or
Waitrose on board, else nobody is going to notice. I've observed more than once
a big client influencing the orientation of a product so much that at the end
it is next to impossible to sell it to someone else. Many businesses that start
as product companies, become consultancies by following this path. This brings
us to the "laws" in the next section.

### Mistrioti's laws on UK IT businesses

1. Every UK based IT business has a tendency to do a little bit of consulting.
2. Because of entropy and (1) all British IT businesses end up becoming
consultancies.

## So why exactly is this bad?

For two reasons:

* Businesses and models are not shielded from disruption
* It poisons the internal structure of the companies.

### Disruption

The question on "what's going on here?" started to manifestate on me while
talking to people in the industry but mostly while working. Some discussions
didn't make sense. Then one day while studying "Living in the UK" as part of
my citizenship application I came across this:

So we are in a country that generates whole sectors such as computing (Turing)
and web (Tim B. Lee), has access to huge amounts of capital (City) but then
capitalisation happens across the Atlantic.

One answer was in the Tanenbaum VS Alan Kay debate in the 90s, but
for some reason that doesn't seem enough. Where's the British Google, Amazon,
Paypal?

For the country as a whole it leaves all businesses open to
disruptions. For people working there especially foreigners (such as me) it
creates a glass wall barrier.

Let's talk a bit about internal structuring

For most of the places that I've observed the structuring

Rewrite

This blog post sums up discussions that I've made with different people of the IT industry mostly in London including personal experience. It's not academical nor attempts to reflect a dogma.

TL;DR: It is assumed that local IT companies treat their products or services as a side-effect compared to the relationships with key business partners. This has consequences to the priorities and internal structuring of organisations that include many aspects such as day to day tasks up to racial/national descrimination.

Recording:

My aim is to write down some thoughts about the blog post and take it on from there.

1st thing that impressed me when I came to live in this country ... STOP

Before coming to UK I had some academical exposure to businesses operations and finance, because I graduated from a "business" university.
Here I started attending startup courses/seminars. Up to now I've participated in three courses/seminars. One of those was more oriented towards US-style, let's say "silicon valley" startups, the other two were mostly about starting-up which for me without going into details are two completely different things. In those two and that was what impressed me was that we were shown the marshlow pyramid of needs, projected into a business version.
As in the original pyramid you have at the bottom the need for food and shelter, on the business there was the accumulation of resources: mining, agriculture, oil drilling ets. On the top layers we had utilites, services, with full customised solutions on the top. The higher your you are positioned as a business in the "business" pyramid, the higher are your margins. The lower, the margin gets lower. The first question would be why would someone want to be in the bottom of the pyramid? Two answers: either there is no other option, or more probably on the bottom we have more volume. While writing these lines I was at home looking to a fruit bowl with some bananas. If you cultivate and sell bananas, everybody in the world is a potential customer. If you manifacture banana-based deserts with cream then you limit your audience to those who can afford it and like that particular desert, something more specific, targeted to less people with a higher price.

What I foun out the more I was living in UK was that this mindset...
STOP

First a discussion about market size, in comparisson with US, which is the second element of my findings, there is a managerial mono-culture. While in the US there might be the Chigago, school, the New York school, etc for businesses or on IT some might have read about the "MIT/New-Jersey" disctintion here: http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html.
In any while in the US we have different approaches based on different industries, in Britain we have the so called Oxbridge (a word I very recently learned), and everyone else who wants to be like them or gets influeced from them. It feels like if an opinion gets proven and cemented, then there is not another counter-opinion available that would start discussions on where and which something is more appropriate.

I observed that this approach is also projected on IT busineesses. There is that desire to chase higher margins. Like no matter what you do, you want to be a little bit of a consultancy: You should find a very rich client(s) that has/have very specific needs and establish a cash flow/business relationship - suck their cash. Think of a pump that pumps cash from that fictional but specific client to your company.

I remember that while on the first startup, a mentor had told us that the fact of builing a genric product at the time, was a very good door opener that would start discussions on selling consulting services around that product. The advice of the mentor was something in the lines of: "it's ok to build features for everyone on your spare time, but you should be looking for that big client X that needs very specific features just for them". Think for a moment how different that is from say the 37 signals approach where consulting is treated more or less like a disease that we need to get rid of. The first reaction was to assume that I was discussing with people that have started businesses in domains other than IT, or new to mentoring or something.

As time was passing by I started realising that this was the most established or popular approach. My main thesis in this article, having reached this point, is that this mentality is the terminal desease of the British IT industry, which I will further explain later. Overreacting and reaching out a bit further I'd add the third argument in the mix:
Recently I had to study for the "Living in the UK" test. In the preparatory book there was a section about discoveries of contemporary Brightons. There was Tim Burners Lee, inventor of the web as well as Alan Turing. It's a little bit strange that although the country produces brains that can innovate and produce technology, this is not reflected in the size of the industry. Modern IT/software is being led from the US, not UK. Why is that?

Let's backtrack on why I believe this is cancer. For two reasons. The first one has to do with the well known property of software, that after something gets produced, there is no extra marginal cost of producing an additional unit. This stands even more by the popularisation of web applications. Id we had that discussion before than there would be at least CDs, shipping, installations etc. Now we are talking about web, apps etc. As a result someone that starts on the bottom of that pyramid, after getting established, it is very easy to start climbing up, "conquering" more space moving upwards. While this happens existing players will get pushed away, maybe leaving out some very specific nieches on the top layers. The mechanings and how this happens has been thoroughly studied in Kristensen's "Innovators Dillema". In the IT industry the whole process is a little bit more brutal. So no matter what a British company does if it is consulting oriented, it is destined to die by an American competitor.

Let's take selling books as an example. Suppose that someone was aiming for very expensive rare and collective prints, aiming at the high end of the market, whatever. I don't know if a company like that ever existed but suppose it did. Now think of Amazon, selling cheap with a low margin. After some years Amazon has warehouses, storage, optimised delivery channels, suppliers. After some years, it would be very easy to assemble a team of specialists and ask them to attack that high margin custom market. I am sure that by utilising the existing network and resources, they will be eventually be able to do it. They can win either by offering the same level of services with a lower price, or by more services on the same pricing levels, having lower costs. We can think of or remember many other examples.

Another reason is that almost never companies that are sitting on the top of the pyramid did any attempts to acquire lower layers. Say something like an inverse Toyota-Lexus. Almost nobody does it Kristensen mentions Intel with Celeron. It is very rare. What we have is companies doing tons of research, delivering and supporting customised solutions and then wait to die, by someone who is doing this cheaper and better. The second fact that derives because of this, which is a bit personal, is the internal hierarchy of goals inside a company. Looking inside the company, how it decides what is important and what's not or how much. After we saw companies individually as "black boxes" and the macro aspects as well as competition, let's look now inwards.

Looking inwards Ι have seen that the most important functions are not those related to production, such as IT, programming or creativity. The most important is to satisfy the customer, hence the more important people are not those that produce (example programmers in software or say administrators for an ISP), but those that are exposed to the clients. It's those that have client facing roles or facing suppliers, let's call it <something>-facing (*-facing). This has two important implications. Those who are actually contributing feel marginalised or second class citizens, plebs plevians. Another thing is that many times our companies treat us (treat them) as necessary evil / side effect. So for a company that produces software, programmers seem to be something that you need to have, even an expense. Why is that? - The answer is that "software" is not what matters, what matters is the "relationship" with the paying clients, that by the way - buy software. If it could have "just" have only the relationship, then the company would be very happy to lay-off all of it's value producing stuff. I've seen it many times happening, for example where I am currently employed, I'm not 100% sure that I head it, but initially we had a number of programmers that had to have many interactions with other departments in order to iterate over what type of software is needed. The moment we found a solution decided what type of software is needed and was build, someone asked if we could be outsourced. So the employee is working in order to become unemployed. Get for a moment in my shoes and think that if you deliver projects on time and on budget, you'll get a big layoff. That's because what you do is a "cost", what we need to invest in, the crown jewel is the relationship with the client. This happens because we (and many others do not) sell volume. When you sell volume each client's importance is dilluted along with the number of other clients that the company has (How important can you be to Microsoft?). Taking one step more it has other consequences such as that the investements and allocation of resources is adjusted accordingly. For example most British companies prefer to have a good marketing team VS a good development team, that's because the person who brings the bacon is not who produces good result, but the one that talks to 2-3 clients and convinces them to buy or keep buying. This, returing to the previous argument makes these companies very vulnerable to someone that produces volume (on the IT sector). Eventually because their products will become cheaper and better, the clients will move there on their own.
We can see this happening all around: data centers and Amazon? many.
The last thing observed for first-generation immigrants like me, is the racial and national distribution of labour inside companies. I've seen that in many companies the personel engaged with production originates mostly from central Asia (India, Pakistan) or from the European south (PIGS). When we go to project management we have British, mostly English, with some second generation immigrants. What I have observed is after you get adjusted to the country, stay for some years and start to spread your wings or climbing up the hierarchy you come across a glass wall, there is no more. A vicious circle is born/revealed: immigrants are considered as people that have come to London, not in order to work or follow a career, but to do some chores and then go home. Hence they will be assigned with unimportant tasks, so that companies can afford to lose them - which in our case is the actual production. Notice that this is an intiosyncracy of IT or creative domains. The vicious circle is created by the fact that these people do not receive investments, training, opportunities to advance, but as expandable tampons are used and then thrown away. From their end they will not develop corporate loyalty (I've read in tons of CVs people staying in a position for say two years), no payment increases. As an impact the products of each company are of low quality only because of the turn-around. Until the next engineer gets there, learns how the project was structured, developed and starts to provide directions and additions, he/she leaves! So companies have essentially high-paid consultants that cannot do anything else than tamper their clients in a situation that leads nowhere. In the worst company that I've been, in every aspect including technology, all the project managers were English, the rest euro-south. I remember the story of a friend of mine.. leave it.
Next, which I am saying just in order to have all bases covered -plirotita - is that this has an impact to the quality of the product, architecturar layout etc. It has to do with- competition. Already covered by the previous arguments, most projects even if they started as products or services, end up as consulting Frankensteins for "very important customers". So after having the first or second or third one etc, the required effort from client N to client N+1 is huge (compared to profit). That's because there will probably be the need for a little bit of functionality and the previous client N hacks need to be  somehow be accomodated. I am quite sure based on literature that from the other side of the Atlantic, there is some sort of analysis and if a feature does not yield any considerable profit in the long run, it does not get implemented or supported. We have seen features getting removed from subsequent versions or projects becoming unsupported. (Steve Blank article on removing web features). An example could be Google and RSS readers; nobody said that many people might not use it, but head of MegaCorp reads RSS every morning. I have witnessed projects reaching a state of paralysis where the addition of something small like an extra view or fixing a bug, is so painful and expensive that becomes impossible not only to introduce that change, but to communicate the state of the mess in human terms. Once I've experienced a discussion about "why do we pay all those people that cannot do anything? Should we outsource it to that company in India that they only say yes?". Outsourcing produced just postpones that vicious circle because eventually the cost will go up again.

These are my thoughts about the issue, moreover... PAUSE.
