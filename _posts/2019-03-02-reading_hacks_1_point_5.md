# Reading Hacks 1.5 - Don't Read that Book

I was gathering material to re-write the 3 years old post READING HACKS-LINK
when as life makes it happen, I decided to do a detour and discuss when a book's
first page should never get to be opened in the first place aka when you
should "*never buy that book*" at all.

As luck dictated, inspiration for this came again from fight mediocracy's
related video - LINK, writings and essays of Nickolas Naseem Taleb TWITTER LINK
which brought up personal experiences and findings.

Decided not to provide exhaustive bibliography or references. Decide for
yourself, or stop here if you are a reference junkie. If you are still here
in the last 4-5 years I concluded that the following more or less happen:

1.  There are people today that read A-L.O.T. like a lot: they read as many
book as possible. There is an overlap with reading as much as possible. Also
there are many people that do not read at all, or very little.
2.  It is almost easy to quantify how much the voracious readers "consume"
books, one good metric is the annual "Reading Challenge" of GoodReads.com where
some users vouch that they will read say "at least 50 books this year".
3.  The above are the main group that it is easier to sell a book to. Some of
them might want to improve their "book frags" and achieve some sort of high
score, some others might want to have read everything that is out there for
a specific subject. Last but not least many people have been convinced that
the more they read, the better they become at a field or generally as people.
Generally there is a tilt towards the quantity over quality.
