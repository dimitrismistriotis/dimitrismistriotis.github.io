# Reading Hacks 1.5 - Don't Read that Book

I was gathering material to re-write the 3 years old post READING HACKS-LINK
when as life makes it happen, I decided to do a detour and discuss when a book's
first page should never get to be opened in the first place aka when you
should "*never buy that book*" at all.

As luck dictated, inspiration for this came again from fight mediocracy's
related video - LINK, writings and essays of Nickolas Naseem Taleb TWITTER LINK
which brought up personal experiences and findings.

Decided not to provide exhaustive bibliography or references. Decide for
yourself, or stop here if you are a reference junkie. If you are still here
in the last 4-5 years I concluded that the following more or less happen:

1.  There are people today that read A-L.O.T. like a lot: they read as many
book as possible. There is an overlap with reading as much as possible. Also
there are many people that do not read at all, or very little.
2.  It is almost easy to quantify how much the voracious readers "consume"
books, one good metric is the annual "Reading Challenge" of GoodReads.com where
some users vouch that they will read say "at least 50 books this year".
3.  The above are the main group that it is easier to sell a book to. Some of
them might want to improve their "book frags" and achieve some sort of high
score, some others might want to have read everything that is out there for
a specific subject. Last but not least many people have been convinced that
the more they read, the better they become at a field or generally as people.
Generally there is a tilt towards the quantity over quality.

The above describe a cluster of "over-demand". I have to say that I am not
innocent here. I got caught in similar behaviour in 2017-2018 when I became
active on GoodReads. It started with me importing books that I had read in the
past plus some comics (graphic novels) so that I would get better
recommendations. Later on I got hooked. Realised this when I bought the 2
volumes of XXXX from YYYY:

Initially I did not like the fact that I had to carry 2 books on my suitcase,
then while taking the photo to send to a friend, something like
"at least it will count as 2 items towards my reading challenge" crossed
briefly my mind. Then decided to write this post.
4.  Recommendation engines: Mainly from Amazon but also others. After you
enter some "data point", which could be items purchased on the platform or
just browsing history, each platform can suggest you things that you will most
possibly fancy. After one suggestion becomes a purchase, then more and
recommendations will be generated on the same, when not on similar, topic. By
definition one might want to expand their knowledge there or keep up to date
hence continuing purchasing there. Also these options are also a "safe choice".
This creates the same problem that we have from news sources and social media.
Soon one will have news only from sources they like living in their ideological
vacuum. In the same way people get locked in reading books on the same subject.
This becomes borderline funny in literature genres such as fantasy with people
reading things like medieval sword and sorcery with werewolves but not vampires.

Leaving the over-demand part aside for the time being, it is also alarmingly
paired with over-supply, specifically:

1.  There are many "fake" authors: if we go back in time many people were
writing in magazines or newspapers. Some articles that were becoming too big
might become published in different monthly or quarterly instalments, or the
specific issue might be dedicated to them. In the fantasy genre I can think of
Robert E. Howard and "Weird Tales" or that Michael Moorcock was publishing a
fanzine. Today these people will be pushed to publish a book. Ideas that could
be expressed in 100 pages (80 if condensed), are artificially inflated to
become a 300 page book.
2.  Similarly authors that might have two ideas and would write in the past one
book with two parts, one for each idea, now would be pushed to inflate each
part and publish two books instead.
3.  There is also a "scene" of events and talks from experts which could be
named as the "Ted-X plague". Many people, mostly  but not necessarily business
consultants want to go there, present themselves and hike up their consulting
fees. Because this would somehow be too blunt, they have to hide this under
presenting their distilled wisdom or their findings while working in their
industry. Ergo they publish a book.
  I remember these patterns from the music industry as I was interviewing
musicians 20 years before. Back then on the CD heyday bands wanted to be in
festivals where "the money was". In order to do that, companies were pushing
them to release an album roughly every 2 years (one year to compose and record,
one year to tour in the winter and do festivals in the summer, repeat). There
were many bands that died because they were to small to push back and ask for
a third year in between so that they could refine their ideas, there were many
mediocre albums released because some good ideas were put aside so that they
would be explored on the next album: why have one when you can have 2? Put
three "filler" tracks and release.
4.  Social media effect: Author releases book, author does a promo campaign,
book is everywhere: Interview in every other podcast, Youtube video channels,
pops up as trending on Amazon, recommended here and there. It must be worthy
of your time, not?
5.  The Mark Millar effect: named after the author of "Kick Ass". We have lots
of content produced only to experiment with its readers as guinea pigs for
movies or other more profitable media. Major offender is Mark Millar whose
comics after "Kick Ass" became a movie all look like storyboards from a
production movie. There was the "Handbook For Mortals"" scandal a few years
back for people that want to have some more points of reference. Essentially
the supply side is inflated with material that would normally **never** be
published only because its sales figures can be a very good proxy for a
multi-million dollar movie's box office numbers.
