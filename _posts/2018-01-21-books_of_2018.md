# Books of 2018

Was writing reviews on GoodReads, copy here.

## Extreme Ownership

One of the books that wanted to read twice, with the first time when it was released back in 2015-6. Twelve leadership principles in the following format: What happened in battle, since the main author Jocko is an ex-Navy Seals, discussion-definition of the principle, followed by applications in businesses based from the consultancy currently operaeted by them.

Book is split into three parts with each discussing one principle. From each one of them the ones that grabbed my attention most was "Extreme Ownership", "Prioritize and Execute", and "Discipline Eguals Freedom - The Dichotomy of Leadership".

Although read twice, I will get back to it to steal some quotes for further use :).

## How Comics Work

With comics being my favourite medium I am always after books/material that lets you look under the hood. With that when finding Dave Gibon's book I knowing his work knew I would like it and enjoy reading it. Will deffer from giving a rank as this should be done from professionals or active enthusiasts of the medium.

## Thank You for Being Late

Note: Got a copy of this book as part of author's promotional tour. I want to
thank him and the publisher for this. I also listened to his presentation which
illustrated the main points in this book.

Unfortunately this book suffered from very bad timing. As I often read two books
in parallel I happened to be reading Nicolas Naseem Taleb's "Antifragile" at the
same time where at some point Thomas Friedman is totally discredited as "having
no skin in the game", aka writing opinions without a consequence for these
opinions on his life nor journalistic integrity. At the same time a friend of
mine (did not check) informed me that Friedman advocated in favour of the two
Iraq wars as something "good for Globalisation". For me along these lines this
is where the problem with the author and as an extension with the book is.

Author is a great story teller and his writing has wonderful flow, there is the
first problem: he tailors probably subconsciously his arguments to fit the
narrative. There are for example five main factors driving "the future" (four
plus one really: "What the Hell Happened in 2007?", "Moore’s Law", "The
Supernova", "The Market", "Mother Nature"). Why five? Why not ten or twenty or
just three. Maybe because five is a good number for lists or makes a better
story?

Second is his politics, there is a Hillary Clinton champaign socialism certainty
is his words (without consequences to him - let's repeat this) specially on how
he communicates that things are inevitable with the rest of us only able to
adjust better or take advantage. For example: economic Globalisation:
inevitable; even in the Pyramids, they sell souvenirs "made in China". As we
see though recently we are past the peak-Globalisation and now nations and
communities are exploring more local approaches (Brexit one of them). This for
the author instead of a historical circle (spiral) with peaks and bottoms is
more like a blip in the radar. No problem he can say that he predicted that in
his next book...

I could pick up some additional examples like how his native Minnesota has-to
accept a huge influx of immigrants (like me), just because Globalisation, Global
Warming, without ever asking the current residents if are OK with that or on
which terms (this from his talk did not read the last chapter of the book).
Decided it is best to stop here as I assume my reader has got the point.

With that I would suggest this book only to people that are into writing and
want to see how it is done by a master of the art. I still read his column from
time to time, and really think he is a good person with good intentions, but
from this books - stay away.

## Princess of Mars

Decided to go for a deep dive into vintage science fiction see how it stands
today, if popular or used to be popular cultural artefacts have passed the test
of time and how. First stop "Edgar Rice Burroughs" and "Princess of Mars".

I will not dive in the plot which is generally available on the Internets
(see [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14539907-princess-of-mars)
or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Princess_of_Mars)) will only
comment on how I felt reading it today.

Generally there were places where the book is really amazing wondering how
much of a genius Burroughs must have been, at places it seems that it has not
aged well, while some elements do not match with contemporary tastes or clichés.
I rushed reading it because I wanted to continue reading other things, but at
the end it left me wanting some more. Burroughs made me at the end "live in" and
"see" his Mars, so a part of me wants to get back while feeling a sense of loss
while writing these lines.

**What I loved**: (saying it again) felt of being along with the protagonist,
The technology of Mars, the local non-human tribes, princess is sexy.
**What did not like so much**: (1) How the protagonist, John
Carter, has an unfair disadvantage from day one (he is stronger because of
being from Earth), and then another one (can read others' thoughts but not
vice-versa). Generally things are a bit too easy for him. (2) Generally how he
moved the romantic affair with the princess, Dejah Thoris, with which he fell
in love. I would prefer a more Conan (let's do it) approach, but this is part
of how author wanted to build characters.
Where I am guilty: I love Robert E. Howard's Conan, so I thought I would find
a "Conan in Mars", which is not the case.

Verdict: At some point in life I will continue with the second book of the
series, but next stop will be Dynamite's and other Graphic Novel adaptations.

Some notes on the IDW Publishing Hardcover edition with illustrations from
Michael Wm. Kaluta: I knew Kaluta from other works of his and really appreciated
his talent once I found out who he is (it seems that is art was all around me,
without me noticing). Pros: the book has been very well taken care of, feels
that people from IDW took care of their heritage and wanted to produce the
best they could. There is only one problem: the book is plainly HUGE for no
reason. Very large fonts and while opening the package I realised that I had
not checked the dimensions because I could not fathom that it would be so big.
This gets it straight to armchair, coffee-table, I do not have a shelf big
enough to put it and definitely could not travel with it. I believe something
more A4-ish could achieve all their goals or a smaller font/line spacing which
would make it at least less thick.

## Skin in the game

I was amazed to see how fast I devoured this book it took me so little time that
had to check Wordery's dispatch date just to be sure: a little bit more than 10
little less than 15 days. Will definitely read it again at some point in the
 near - I hope- future.

Some notes, not a full review, just some complimentary thoughts.

This is my second Incerto book after "Antifragile" and increases its effect
on me and some behaviors: Perception of east-Mediterranean identity, risk
taking (after reading Taleb I tend to take more and smaller risks), how to
learn, whom to talk with and about what, and more. An example is which books to
buy: is book X Lindy-optimal or is it something pop that will vanish in 3 years
most? One will be surprised to see how many fall in the latter category. Also is
it written from someone that has "skin in the game" or is it a Varoufakis/Paul
Krugman/armchair academic type of thing? Should I throw away or recycle things
that I do not need (via "via negativa")?

As a side-note, someone correctly wrote here that while reading author's posts
and following him on Twitter a large part of book's content is known to you.
This is good because reading them in an actual book allowed to dive in the
individual concepts. It is understandable though that some people might have
been bored a little.

## Economix

**Update reading notes, page 239**:

Great and joyful to read. Lots of info. I am confused on the author's position
towards big government. He seems to be in favour of it when it acts as he wants,
against it when it acts against his wish (USA gov. it is). I really thought
based on his arguments that he would prefer less intervention, in the last
pages, about 1945 and onwards it seems that the "story" of economics is a story
of governmental intervention.

**Update reading notes, page 270**:
Close to the end of the book, claim of one commenter in GoodReads 100% spot on
unfortunately: half of the book is actually what the title is about and what the
book promises, last half is about author's political beliefs. Apart from some
laughable claims such as how good the government of Venezuela was or about
the Greek protesters (lackey's of the current government more than anything
else), the whole endavor is a little bit immoral: Author starts the half
of the book with facts or at least tries to explain economic phenomena then
serves us author's opinions and (semi-socialist) beliefs. So for the naive
reader it could be something like: Fact-Fact-Fact-Fact-Fact-The end, while it
actually is Fact-Fact-Debatable as Fact-Opinion-Opinion.

I will read it until the end but I lost faith.

**Last update**:
Finished the book earlier today. 100% confident that the author has good
intentions, really liked the content in the last pages (challenges and future),
but still the book ended up not feeling exactly good for me, mainly because
it does not work as advertised. Though some great cartoons and insights here.

## When to Jump: If the Job You Have Isn't the Life You Want - Mike Lewis

I kind of cheated here as I did not read the whole book but only the parts that
interested me. Being currently in "jump-mode" I read only the introduction and
the final "Don't look back" section. Second cheat is that I did not purchase
the book but was given to me on a promotion tour by the speaker.

The book has a pattern on what to do if you do not like your job and/or the
career trajectory and how to move from there to where you want to be.
This theory has emerged from the life of the author and people that have
interacted with him, so we are talking about pure epistimology here. The vast
majority of "When to Jump"'s content is two/three page essays of different
people around the world in each stage. From this perspective the book is
essentially an great articulation of very well edited blog posts about one
subject put in one place.

The whole premise felt like being in the category of books that one would love
if given as a gift but would not buy. I would suggest to resist that tendency
and give it a shot if you find it in a bookstore.

**Reminder to future self**: write about my jump.

## Pirate Wars

It is one of those books for which both the comments against it are right
**and** those in favor of it are right as well. Very informative, author tried
to be objective, liked the approach of not trying to romanticize piracy nor
the pirates themselves, but also very dry and hard to read.
It is one of those books that you start reading with vigor and then you just
cannot bear any more (read in a review that a person started and dropped it
three times, when read seemed an exaggeration, now makes perfect sense). For
me that point was after the middle of the book. I just wanted to finish it so
it was the only book I took with me while using the bus/tube.

How/why I piked it up: This is funny: it was dropped in a "take me" area in
a local café  chain (Nero/UK), where I then being a good patron dropped another
one the next day being a good patron. Else I would never knew its existence.

## Watching the English - Kate Fox

As I am in a period of not necessarily read books cover to cover, I
declare myself as "done" with this as I have read approximately 60% of it.
Freely skipped chapters on driving (I do not drive), fashion and etiquette
(outsourced to Lu. and So.) or having sex with the natives (my wife might
have some objections). With this and that I am sure that I did not miss much
as the book follows a pattern of what is Englishness which after established
becomes the norm for everything else, like if you read the solider rules you
will be able to have a good educated guess on the rules of the workplace and
vice versa.

If I had to pick on something in this book, my copy is the 2014 revision, is
that it perhaps conveniently does not comment on recent changes of the social
landscape namely mass immigration (people like me), socialism such as NHS
(which stands for "No Health under Socialism" - people unlike me), Political
Correctness, 3rd wave femi-nazism and other corroding aspects of the English
society and identity. I would like to read something about the state dependency
of elements of the not-working class for example. Specially for "work" where
many first generation immigrants interact more with locals, there could be
some extra content.

The second aspect is that the book is huge, not unnecessarily so though and
being an academic/scientist and trying to articulate things.

Nevertheless I would suggest to every foreigner that wants to come and stay
at times boring perhaps because the author needs to balance her tone between
a bit or perhaps more in our(?) little island to spent some time at least
skimming through its pages and familiarize themselves with the norms and
manners of these great but oh-so difficult people who I love so much although
they have caused me so much trouble. I wish I had read it sooner like in my
second or third year here.

(according to the author by reading this I broke at least 3 taboos while I
have been "partially infected" with Englishness - time for tea)

## Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.11 - Daniel Greenfeld, Audrey Roy Greenfeld

Never thought that a programming book would be so engaging and so fun to read.
Or after having read a couple I thought that the enthusiasm would wane off.
Rare combination: Fun to read, interesting content, some of it can be flair
based on your knowledge on the subject, some of it gold.
I run through it a couple of times to get a grasp of the subjects, while
changing my code-base in small increments following the advice. Will be
circling around it for the next months.

Trying to limit my enthusiasm: (1) Good articulated content, (2) page
turner(!), (3) many references on where to go for here if I want to do more
(4) written from the people that maintain cookiecutter so purchasing it kind
of makes me feel that I am helping them financially for all the time they
saved me.

You only need to be a bit cautious if you do not know Python beforehand as it
is a Django book not a Python one. Cannot wait (it is Saturday) for Monday to
touch my code-base to implement more recommendations.


## Starship Troopers - Robert A. Heinlein

Wow... OK first of all thanks to the people who did a review on Goodreads because they helped to manage expectations that what I would read in the book does not necessarily map 1 to 1 to what happens in the movie and vice versa.

Story reads as the account of the experiences of the narrator, how he got engaged in the war, his days at training at school, at training, etc. The whole narration is very human/earth centered.

What I really liked about the book is that it has three ways to read it: First as a sci-fi pulp novel: the war against the bugs. Second how a society reacts against a totalitarian adversary. The parallels with communism are obvious, which makes the book still relevant today with the media full of similar totalitarian propaganda ("democratic socialism" aka crypto-communism to name my least favorite). The third part is about who and why should make the decisions in a society. This is where the book suggests a strict but viable alternative, so there is also some political science in the margins.

## Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain - David Gerard

Want to thank my friend Stamatios for gifting me this book.
One note about it: It is un-put-down-able. The way Gerard writes is addictive.
I stopped all my other reading until I could finish this one. Even in points
I do not necessarily agree he made my laugh out.

Memento, that awkward moment when the author approves your review:

## Terraform: Up and Running: Writing Infrastructure as Code - Yevgeniy Brikman

Mixed feelings: Good book, great content which puts you into the mindset of
DevOps with Terraform. I used the tool then got "back to the library to get
some theory" and then went fresh and happy to apply my learning.

This is where a negative surprise hit: book is based on an older version of the
tool so the content which I tried to use ("terraform remote" specifically) is
deprecated which means that I now have to re-learn all that stuff...

I could not find good erratta nor the Github repository of the book has updated
the sample code or chapters... Bummer.

## Book 1, Cleo - Herodotus

Not going to put "stars" nor comment on the content but will comment on a
question that I had and reading "Cleo" answered me on if we should read as
close to the source as we can, in this case a rewrite of the text into modern
Greek, or if we should prefer modern writings of the subject that might take
into account different authors or more contemporary material.

Answer is  both: (my) grandpa Herodotus writes and talks in a way that can be
described as cyclical. Also when he talks about say nation A encountering
nation B, he will stop and give lots of information for B and then continue the
story where it left. This story within a story within event within geography is
a bit hard for contemporary readers. Modern authors rewrite the same material
in linear fashion which is in fashion today and add recent discoveries, cross
check facts, and maybe spice it up with a photo or two.

## Τα Χρονικά του Δρακοφοίνικα - Γιάννης Ρουμπούλιας

Δεν ξέρω πως και γιατί αλλά αφού τελείωσα το 1ο βιβλίο του Ηροδότου ήθελα μια
καλή δόση "Sword and Sorcery". Κάπως έτσι είδα τα "Χρονικά" στην βιβλιοθήκη,
είχαν περάσει 2-3 μετακομίσεις αλλά ποτέ δεν είχαν διαβαστεί
εντελώς.

Ο λόγος έχει να κάνει με το ότι ήταν το τελευταίο ή ένα από τα τελευταία κόμικ
που διάβαζα όταν έβγαιναν. Μοιραία το μυαλό "σκάλωνε" στο τελευταίο ζεστό
καλοκαίρι που είχα περάσει στη Ελλάδα ρουφώντας με πίσω εκεί ή σε ένα
εναλλακτικό παρόν όπου μετά τις σπουδές μου έχω γυρίσει πίσω. Αυτό το
Σαββατοκύριακο κατάφερα να ξεφύγω και να το διαβάσω όλο :).

Τι μου άρεσε: Ότι είχε πολύ από όλα: τα σπαθιά του, τα μεσαιωνικά όπλα του,
τις σφαγές του, τους μονολόγους του, τα αστεία με καλό βρισίδι στους διαλόγους
του, τους χαρακτήρες που μετάνιωσαν, τους πολεμιστές του, τους μάγους του, το
σεξ του, τα πηδηματάκια του, το ρομάντζο του, τις "φυλές" του... πολύ.

Τι δεν μου άρεσε: το σχέδιο κάπως "τραχύ" - είμαι σίγουρος πως οι συντελεστές
έχουν εξελιχθεί από τότε και αν το διαβάσουν αυτό δεν θα ενωχληθούν. Επίσης
το σχέδιο θυμίζει έντονα "ελληνικά κόμικ", δεν ξέρω γιατί (δεν είμαι ειδικός)
αλλά κάπως κοντά στο τότε καλούπι. Το δεύτερο είναι ότι με τα πολλά ονόματα,
φυλλές, κλπ κάπου χανόμουνα.

Επόμενοι σταθμοί: ένα αυτοτελές που είδα ότι έχει βγεί στον ίδιο κόσμο και
"Πόναν ο Μάρμαρος". Πώς τα αγοράζουμε απο Βρετανία πείτε μου μόνο κάποιος...

## The Silk Roads: A New History of the World - Peter Frankopan

Just a little bit long but definitely necessary reading. Along with the Talebs
of the world helped me refocus, examine some elements of my cultural identity
and reevaluate how this planet got here and where it is going next.

For the impatient read the conclusion.

## Καφενείον η Άνοιξις - Θεόφιλος Αιγινήτης

Το βιβλίο είναι δώρο του συγγραφέα οπότε δεν δίνεται βαθμός.

Με μια πρόταση: διαβάζεται σαν να βλέπεις μια ελληνική ταινία δεκαετίας 70 που
ένα μεγάλο τμήμα της έχει ανατεθεί στον Βλάσση Ρασιά.

Το βιβλίο αν ήταν πιάτο θα ήταν ένα πιάτο από μεζέδες (meze platter) όπου έχει
πολλά διαφορετικά διανοητικά εδέσματα στην δοσολογία που επέλεξε ο συγγραφέας.
Έχει λαογραφία, την αποδόμηση της ψυχής και της υποδομής της χώρας που
συνέβαινε τότε, νεανικοί έρωτες, σκέψεις για τα γεράματα, λίγο αστυνομικό
μυθιστόρημα σε κάποια σημεία και τέλος υπεράσπιση της των Ελλήνων νόσου.
Βάλτε και ένα σχέδιο σε κάθε κεφάλαιο μιας και ο συγγραφέας είναι ΚΑΙ ζωγράφος.

Εμένα μου άρεσε διότι δεν είναι από τα βιβλία που διαβάζω συνήθως οπότε σαν
κάτι διαφορετικό ανανέωσε λίγο τις σχεδόν μονότονες επιλογές μου. Επίσης η
πλούσια θεματολογία με έκανε να θέλω να διαβάζω συνέχεια "μια σελίδα ακόμη"
(page turner το λένε). Αυτό όμως καλώς ή κακώς είμαι σίγουρος πως σε πολύ κόσμο
μπορεί να μην αρέσει ειδικά εάν διαβάζει αρκετά ελληνικά βιβλία όπου μπορεί
το αστυνομικό κομμάτι να του θυμίζει το βιβλίο Α, το λαογραφικό το Β κλπ.
Ίσως να είμαι και εγώ ένας "Θεόφιλος" μιας και έχω κάνει πολλά και διαφορετικά
πράγματα οπότε ότι γράφω έχει πιο πολύ πλάτος αντί βάθος ή να μπλέκω θέματα.

Αν το συναντήσετε ρίξτε μια ματιά και θα έλεγα δοκιμάστε το, ειδικά εάν έχετε
αποκοπεί από την νεοελληνική παραγωγή.

## Μπλέ Κομήτης - Ευάγγελος Ανδρουτσόπουλος

Μου έλειπε κάτι τέτοιο. Να ευχαριστήσω τον υπάλληλο/ιδιωκτήτη (;) του
Comicon shop που μου το σύστησε.

## Απόβαση στη Φλάνδρα - Παναγιώτης Τσαούσης

Δεν με κράτησε...

Μου αρέσουν πολύ τα κόμιξ με αεροπλάνα οπότε το αγόρασα/δοκίμασα. Σενάριο
τραβηγμένο από τα μαλλία (πάνω και κάτω) το οποίο σε άλλους ίσως αρέσει σε
άλλους όχι σε εμένα δεν άρεσε και δεν με κράτησε.

Το ίδιο περίπου με το σχέδιο, το στυλ του είναι πολύ πρόχειρο (ίσως
επιτιδευμένα πρόχειρο) με αρκετά πάνελς δείχουν "άδεια", παρότι φαίνεται ότι
το υλικό είναι πολύ δουλεμένο από τον συγγρεαφέα ο οποίος σίγουρα έχει κάνει
πολύ καλή ιστορική έρευνα για αεροπλάνα/μηχανές/ντύσιμο/εθνόσημα και άλλες
πολλές λεπτομερειες.

Παρότι λοιπόν έχει πέσει δουλεία, σαν σύνολο κατά τη γνώμη μου - και πολύ
δυστυχώς - πάσχει κάτι που με στεναχωρεί γιατί θα μπορούσαν τα πράγματα να
ήταν πάρα μα πάρα πολύ καλύτερα (η Βρετανική μου πλευρά θέλει να φωνάξει
"lots of potential which has not materialised")

Θα επενδύσω στο μέλλον σε Τσαούση μιας και είδα άλλες δουλείες του με καλύτερη
βαθμολογία.

## The 10% Enterpreneur - Patrick J. McGinnis

Had that book on the list for long. Borrowed copy from a friend but this is
the type of book that you need to have on your own in order to make notes,
assault it with post-its etc.

I will concentrate on one passage which made me reflect (final chapter):

> Once you finish this chapter and close this book, you have an option. You can
> put it back on the physical or digital bookshelf, or you can begin. That's
> where mind-set matters. It's what gets you from daydream to action. It takes
> you to the place where you are starting, doing, and making things happen. I
> hope you're convinced that it's time to get going. Look around you, learn
> from others, join their teams, then build your own 10%.

... which made me reflect why I got the book in the first place: to reinforce
some paths in the brain, since I had already started a couple 10%, get some
motivation, but moreover check out for things I could copy/steal/modify.

With that if you are reading this and looking for an IT person for your 10%,
find me and cold call me as the author suggests :).

## Space Tortoise - Ross Montgomery, David Litchfield

Book is set in a post-nuclar war world as we can see from the debris in
the environment as well as from the complete absence of humans. Animals
brains have mutated evolving them into being capable of using candles.
One of them is a little tortoise, the main character of the book. Our
little friend lives a lonely life in an empty playing ground longing to
meet and be friends with other animals until one day he discovers the
personal journal of Elon Musk...

Read the book for the rest.

## Designing Event-Driven Systems - Ben Stopford

The book was given to me from its author in a convention (cofeve in colloquial
English) which does not allow me to put a start-rating.

With this aside this book does one thing and does this really well, which is
to explain different strategies and patterns and give a good insight on how
to implement them using Apache Kafka. Book contains many good ideas and
description of different concepts, has lots of stuff that I have already
stolen, although a newcomer to the space. Diagrams are very nice diagrams
with a soft choice of colours which makes them almost cute :) for a technical
book (note: Confluent, the company that author has founded site uses similar
hues on their blog posts). If I could praise though the book for one thing it
would be the absence of "fluff" which is so common in technical books these
days, second one is that it promotes the company in a nice subtle way by
giving to the reader lots of value, if the reader wants then to go with the
experts then ... they know what to do next.

## Bayes Theorem: A Visual Inreoduction For Beginners - Dan Morris

GoodReads: 2/5 stars

Think you want some help understanding better or getting into the Bayes
Theorem. Two cases: you have a friend who can help over a coffee on some
back of the envelope stuff or you buy this book.

This books ticks many boxes: Does one thing and does it well, explains
with enough detail, small, cute, articulate.

Then why the 2 stars: One for its price it could have a little bit of
more information, or examples. Two the dead tree / paper version is just
rushed and should not be sold. It is a print out of probably Kindle's
version, which means that there are MANY LINKS but with ZERO URLs. Text
goes like "for XYZ see here" with here being underlined and the
destination is nowhere to be found.

Summarizing: great idea, good concept, but although they could do
something great, very poor execution on the printed version, for things
that could be fixed in 2 hours.

## Python Tricks - Dan Bader

I wanted to check out this book so I downloaded it. Most of the times I do this
end up with me buying the actual book at the end so do not feel that guilty
confessing this "habit". With "Python Tricks" I was very early 100% sure that
would eventually purchase it, which I did.

What I want from a coding book is always the same two things: (1) TO feel
sad+happy while reading it: sad for parts of my codebase and happy that I am
reading it, (2) Understand better patterns of the programming language and
also be able to write better code if possible more idiomatic.

Book delivers both. I immediately changed parts of some applications after
reading the decorators chapter, while I will have the PDF ready in order to
change or write differently some parts of the projects that I am currently
working on.

Some of the material has been posted on-line from the author but the book
really delivers that extra which justifies a purchase from everyone coding in
Python (in-my-not-so-humble-opinion). Last but not least if acquired from the
book's site (see link) there are 12 (!) videos about the main concepts
discussed with live coding sessions with the author explaining the rationale
behind each decision.

Feedback for author as requested:

```python
1 │ if __name__ == '__main__':
2 │     print("Let's see")
3 │     even_squares = (x**2 for x in range(1, 10) if x**2 % 2 == 0)
4 │     neg_squares = (-x for x in even_squares)
5 │     print(list(neg_squares))
```

On list comprehension, using an if statement would demonstrate the point of
simplifying even more the expression. Used same example as author earlier.

A good idea would be to release a generous sampler with a video somewhere
along with a video in a .zip file. This will allow people to check what it the
book is about easier and then get straight to purchase. I would not detract but
possibly could.

## The Laws of Human Nature - Robert Greene

Update:
I'm into where R. Greene explains why people repeat certain (wrong) behaviours again and again... ouch; at least someone writes things I need to read.
I always read R. Greene's books 3 times: One to immerse into the arguments and read the stories of the figures involved (eg: Napoleon, Da Vinci), second to immerse and re-visit his arguments (where I usually underline things), and one last time last to make them stick.
