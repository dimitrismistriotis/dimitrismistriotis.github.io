# Books of 2017

This year decided to keep a list with maybe a short description attached to each book. Also decided to read many of the books twice. Will also catalogue everything including technical tomes and graphic novels.

## 01. Learn Python the hard way - Zed A. Shaw

## 02. Wolfhound Century - Peter Higgins

> Investigator Vissarion Lom has been summoned to the capital in order to catch a terrorist --- and ordered to report directly to the head of the secret police.
A totalitarian state, worn down by an endless war, must be seen to crush home-grown insurgents with an iron fist. But Lom discovers Mirgorod to be more corrupted than he imagined: a murky world of secret police and revolutionaries, cabaret clubs and doomed artists.
Lom has been chosen because he is an outsider, not involved in the struggle for power within the party. And because of the sliver of angel stone implanted in his head.

Police mystery in an alternative soviet world with lots of magic and magical creatures. Real page turner, what's not to love really? Crime/Occult/Politics mix and the corruption of the communist system prevails in different dimensions. How could I not love it?

## 03. Thank you for being late - Thomas Freidman

Did not read it all, large parts of it. Description of what is currently shaping the world which for Freidman is: Moore's law - technology, Climate change - nature, Globalisation - market forces. After setting the scenery he goes on describing how to cope with our modern world and some possible solutions as they emerge to world's problems.

Although have heard lot's of negative comments about the author, while he is also a globalist with which I do not agree 100%, the book has some nice insights. It reads like an extended newspaper column as the author is a world famous columnist.

It was the first book in my life maybe where I decided that I would not deliberately try to read "all of it". Did well here.

## 04. Elastic Leadership - Roy Osherove

Had a sweet tooth for this for years, decided at the end to buy it
