# Books of 2017

This year decided to keep a list with maybe a short description attached to each book. Also decided to read many of the books twice. Will also catalogue everything including technical tomes and graphic novels.

## 01. Learn Python the hard way - Zed A. Shaw

Python makes the world go round. <https://learnpythonthehardway.org/>

## 02. Thank you for being late - Thomas Freidman

Did not read it all, large parts of it. Description of what is currently shaping the world which for Freidman is: Moore's law - technology, Climate change - nature, Globalisation - market forces. After setting the scenery he goes on describing how to cope with our modern world and some possible solutions as they emerge to world's problems.

Although have heard lot's of negative comments about the author, while he is also a globalist with which I do not agree 100%, the book has some nice insights. It reads like an extended newspaper column as the author is a world famous columnist.

It was the first book in my life maybe where I decided that I would not deliberately try to read "all of it". Did well here.
