# Books of 2016

## 01. Broken angels - Richard Morgan

<img alt="" src="http://www.richardkmorgan.com/wp-content/uploads/broken_angels_UK_Hb.jpg" title="Broken angels cover" class="book_post" />

Richard Morgan is the only author whose books I try to read twice. I had read
"Broken angels" more than five years before and apart from a very few scenes I
remembered next to nothing. Follow up to "Altered carbon" with Takeshi Kovacs
in a planet far away from earth in a totally different adventure (no spoilers).
Tough but rewarding page turner. Wanted to read so much that I was just
devouring it, missing less details of the story than the first time and
possibly more than the third if there will ever be one.

The universe of the Kovacs trilogy is unique in it's world building although
a "proper" dystopia, Moran makes me want to be in one of it's planets for a
while. Difficult to digest the concept of "re-sleeving" but while writing these
lines my head is is still full of futuristic weapons, interstellar travel,
Marian spaceships, private armies, religious fanatics, cloak and dagger
betrayal, corporate executives and so many other things on which I will try
not to dwell so that I will not reveal any details of the plot. I really liked
the fact that it's plot is set somewhere far away from planet Earth which I
usually treat as an short-cut from building a good science fiction world,
something that many books suffer from with the previous one "Altered carbon"
of course **excluded**.

On the topic of comparing it with "Alter..." many people found this one somehow
inferior mostly because some of their favourite elements from that one are not
here. I found both books on the same level. I would really favour this one,
if I had to choose between the two, without pushing myself to do so because I
am a fan of the author. The first book had elements and a plot that appeal to a
wider audience, with the second one appealing more to people that enjoy the
specific genre be it science fiction or cyberpunk or dystopian future whatever.

Third and last of the series, "Woken furies", will have to wait for a prolonged
period of free time such as a holiday, since it's size scares me.

## 02. DO/Story/ "How to tell your story so the world listens" - Bobette Buster

<img alt="" src="http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0176/9202/products/Story_c7063825-1738-4b76-a94b-70cb6bff84a2_large.jpg" title="How to tell your story so the world listens" class="book_post" />

Was lucky enough to listen to a speech from the book's author at the end of last year on which I could get a "How to tell..." copy for my to-read list, which I am currently cleaning up. Hope was to assist in improving my writing.

"How to tell..." is an introduction/tour to the art of story telling from a Hollywood-ish angle. Useful as I decided to use the suggested exercises and suggestions for my own writing and blog posts. Book is small in size but packed with the mechanics of story telling, flavoured with stories from the author's and her students' lives as well as from memorable films.

Might check out other books from the same series as the size/utility ratio is intriguing.

## 03. Getting past no - William Ury

This one was a gift that ended up on my "to read" stack, because of an interest that I had expressed in negotiation literature. I started reading it in order to look cool to the person who gave it to me, but luckily I got hooked.

In the first chapters Ury discusses on what you should never do when negotiations go south. It was essentially an enumeration on what I was doing before in the similar occasions so that grabbed my attention. Later on the book discusses it's main subject on how to drive a negotiation with a very negative opponent, following the book's terminology. How to stay calm, where I used to suck, disarm the toxicity, reframe the discussion and so forth.

Having been exposed to "Getting more", "past no" gave insights on these corner cases that do not seem to make sense, happen more often than we thing they should and offer a way to encounter them.

## 04. In search of forever - Rodney Matthews

![In search of forever](/images/in_search_of_forever.jpg "In search of forever cover")

You do not exactly read a book of illustrations but this one is a little
different since it has extensive and thorough descriptions from the person
resposible for tons of stuff that I loved as a kid such as fantasy book covers
and record covers. Bought this in a used book store in a magic place called
Camden. What drew me to it was the fact that I always remembered the covers of
"Praying mantis" records' while at the same time do not remember their sound.
Moorcock's illustrations follow. Liked reading the stories behind magnificent
70s/80s stuff and will definitely be coming back every once in a while to
check them out again.

## 05. The new hardboiled web design - Andy Clarke

![Hardboiled web design cover](images/hardboiled-web-design-andy-clarke-cover_large.png "Hardboiled web design cover")

I decided that I wanted to update my HTML5 knowledge and get up to speed with
the latest developments, mainly HTML5 and CSS3. Being aware of the remarkable
quality of Smashing magazine's printed material along with wanting to compensate
them for all the great material that they produced, I bought it. It was not
exactly what I was looking for, it was way way more!

Although what I needed was there, it was a very small subset of that the book is
about. Andy Clarke takes though his methodology of web design. Instead of the
now outdated "graceful degradation", he suggest a "progressive enhancement"
approach, allowing browsers who support novel features to do so, without
breaking the experience for those who do not (yet). This allows to start from
plain HTML and CSS and create stunning results without frameworks and almost
from scratch. This is one element of the "hardboiled" that triggered a paradigm
shift and provided lots of food for thought. There is a lot of other content and
items covered, I really managed to learn how to align flexboxed content :-).

I would really want to use the hardboiled approach in a future project after
finishing the book. Reading "Hardboiled" really made me wish I had more time in
my hands to learn deeper and do more around web design, hope the opportunity
will arise in the near future.

### 06. The broken sword - Poul Anderson

![The broken sword cover](images/books/broken_sword.jpg "The broken sword cover")

Second recommendation from Richard Morgan who brought the book to my radar. Mindblowing and amazing on how a person could put such a dense story in about 200 pages. Made me see norse/British mythology from a totally different angle. Trivia: The sword of the book is the inspiration for Moorcock's Stormbringer. Page turner, necessary, wish was exposed to such master pieces earlier.

Also it seems that covers have deteriorated over the years. I bought a 70s paperback which has the wonderful cover as seen above while the contemporary one looks like an abstract nothingness... Why?

### 07. Mindset - Carol Dweck

![Mindset cover](images/books/mindset.jpg "Mindset cover")

Being lazy, I will copy from [author's book page](http://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/):

*"Mindset is a simple idea discovered by world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck in decades of research on achievement and success—a simple idea that makes all the difference. In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success—without effort. They’re wrong.In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Virtually all great people have had these qualities."*

An anecdote about Mindset: I had to put into practice what I was reading while reading it. There was a tough situation where I had to choose between responding with a growth or with a fixed mindset. Growth won and honestly I am a different person ever since. Reading this book triggered one of the most intense "mirrors" effect that I had experienced in my whole life: What I was/am doing wrong because of having a fixed mindset, why and how to fix it - should there be the need to.

"Mindset" follows the classic pattern of modern self help/discovery books: theory in first 100 pages where a Harvard business review would stop and then applications of the theory into different areas. Again the reader should cherry pick, but I somehow managed to read it all again. Parenting was tough because it brought back painful memories of receiving fixed mindset parenting, will do better?


### 08. The functional art - Alberto Cairo

Part of my transition to / education on data science. Reflection and notes are being brewed into a separate post...

### 09. Extreme Ownership - Jocko Willink and Leif Babin

![Extreme Ownership cover](images/books/extreme_ownership.jpg "Extreme Ownership cover")

It was one of the few times that I bought the hard-cover version of the book as I usually prefer to wait for the paperback (less space, lower price). But somehow the hype around it made me want to read it as soon as possible. Ownership was a field that I had discovered I needed to work on more, as I had a tendency to over blame others or circumstance. Leaning towards "owning" it, I decided to get and read it.

The authors are both ex-Navy Seals with recent Iraq experience. There was a fear that their experiences would not translate to learnings and applications relevant to day to day life and contemporary businesses. Luckily it seems that this is not the case.

"Extreme Ownership" follows the same pattern in each chapter: Situation in Iraq related to each chapter, discussion on the related principle, followed by applications in the business world for each of the twelve leadership principles presented. Reading it made me understand leadership mistakes that I have made in the past, recognise others that my leaders had done as well as good decisions/leadership examples from me to others or other managers to me. The book is great, maybe not as well written in some places as the authors are not professional authors, but the content compensates something that also the various reviews conclude. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants to lead first himself and then others. I need to improve both, so there was lots of food for thought for me there as well as writing that would make me put the book down and reflect.

These are the 12 principles from the table of contents:

1. Extreme Ownership
2. No bad teams, Only bad leaders
3. Believe
4. Check the Ego
5. Cover and move
6. Simple
7. Prioritise and execute
8. Decentralised command
9. Plan
10. Leading up and down the chain of command
11. Decisiveness amid Uncertainty
12. Discipline equals freedom - the dichotomy of leadership

Although the book is a "tour de force" experience the last chapter "discipline equals freedom" is mind-blowing, still echoing in my head, backed up by strong arguments. So is the afterword: "leadership is simple but not easy".

Personally I would like to ask the authors about when things are a little bit fuzzy in the business world, for actions that might get you in a court martial while in the military: "is there a case where we should ignore orders?", "when should we leave the company we work for for another position?", "Should I ever work for a competitor?"

### 10. Show Your Work! - Austin Kleon

Reread: Would need the material for some side activities so decided to get back to the basics.

[Author's page](http://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/)

### 11. Black Box Thinking: The Surprising Truth About Success - Matthew Sayed

![Black Box Thinking cover](images/books/black_box_thinking-300x420.jpg "Black Box Thinking cover")

If we could conceptualise arguments as nails, then in "Black Box Thinking: The Surprising Truth About Success" Mathew Syed comes with a packet of nails, wields a hammer and nails his thesis in your head in a way that will stay there for ever. "Black box" is about learning from failure but unlike cliche-speak that the name would suggest this book has a journey on how we fail, why, how to learn, why some industries/companies do learn from their mistakes and they improve while others discard them and stay the same.
Backed by author's research, interviews, other material and also UK content which makes the examples more familiar. I started reading it in order to borrow-steal some ideas for my writings but at the end I read it top to bottom.

The difference with other books on the subject is that Mathew Syed gets you by the hand proving each argument with details while never being boring at the same time.

Being overwhelmed/lazy again, a paragraph form author's site: *"Learning from failure has the status of a cliché, but this book reveals the astonishing story behind the most powerful method of learning known to mankind, and reveals the arsenal of techniques wielded by some of the world’s most innovative organizations. Their lessons can be applied across every field – from sport to education, from business to health."*

### 12. Persian Fire - Tom Holland

Was always interested in ancient Persian history after reading about the Persian wars in antiquity: How did these people from so far away could assemble an army to invade Greece and how did they create their empire in the first place? Purchasing "Persian fire" after listening to Dan Carlin's [King of Kings](http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-56-kings-of-kings/) - and [King of Kings part 2](http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-57-kings-kings-ii/), I was soon to find out. The book was not only about Persia as it is concentrated around the Persian wars as well with the difference of presenting both sides of the story as the historical narrative evolves.

Holland's descriptions have the effect of making the reader (OK me) feeling like we were there, like almost smelling the sea of Ionia, looking around in the Streets of Babylon, or seeing as a satrap sends a letter to the great King in Persepolis. The story starts unlike other authors who begin with the Ionian revolution - the first contact of Persians with mainland Greece - with Assyria, then Babylon and so forth through Cyrus's empire steady growth and the annexation of Lydia, which in turn triggered later on the Ionian revolution.

The book helped me revisit heroes of my youth such as Themistocles, answer many historical questions that I had from childhood as why did Macedonia submit to the Persians, and shred new light with more contemporary archaeological research on how ancient Greek society was structured, how were the armies organised and so forth.

Really enjoyed and recommend this one, next stop is either Holland's "Millennium" or a follow up to Alexander the Great's conquests.

### 13. The Truth - Neil Strauss

![The Truth cover](images/books/the_truth-300x432.jpg "The Truth cover")

Was waiting to read the latest book of Neil Strauss after his interview on inside quest:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTunxEitqp0?list=PLKJe4QFOQXK7FjotZmmcC9Uw8po_U8IJ2" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

When I saw the following clip from another beloved channel, "fight mediocrity", I just bought it and started consuming it.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DQA0ec39HNc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The questions that I wanted to answer having seen the clips above were about what happens after "The Game", how does a relationship with a single person evolve? Also how we can deal with our childhood traumas and baggage that we carry in general?

There are many answers, most of them personal, with "The truth" taking you through the author's personal journey. Neil Strauss has his own balance between scientific research, literature, available knowledge corpus (what he's read) melded with his own experiences and life choices (what he's lived). So "The Truth" is very personal, very intense, has experiences that readers would not necessarily pursue (polyamory conferences, orgies), but on the same time learnings that each one can take and apply to their life: as in "The Game" but better :-). It's not "investigative reporting" it would be more "self-investigative reporting".

### 14. Ego is the Enemy - Ryan Holiday

Placeholder

### 15. Rubicon - Tom Holland

![Rubicon cover](images/books/rubicon_300x401.jpg "Rubicon cover")

Had some holiday time that I had to spend at home and decided to spend it some of it checking out ancient Rome. Got interested from podcasts in hardcore history plus the capability of Holland to build a narrative and flow. I had - still have - a problem with Roman names, so if there would be an author that would help me make sense out of it, it must be him.

"Rubicon" is centred around the crossing of Rubicon by Julius Caesar describing the events before that as well as immediate afterwards. What we see is the rise of a superpower which the bigger it becomes the more it corrupts and destroys its institutions. At the end, as it is well known, Caesar gives the final blow to the body of the Republic by becoming dictator.

Holland can take you there, use the different historical details and sources to paint a picture in a flow that is easy and compelling to follow. As in "Persian Fire" which I read some months before, with Rubicon you walk in the Colloseum, debate in the Forum, go for voting in the fields or Mars. You also get to know the Gauls, the Parthians, what was going on in Greece, empress Cleopatra, and also how alien Britania was back then. The lessons from this book and their application to modern politics is at least striking - people never learn.

Recently a friend asked me why I am interested so much specifically in ancient history: it is because people do the same mistakes over and over again, so by studying one specific period you get the same insights as in any other. In antiquity there was less technology, so it is easier to follow and see the characters, and also being Greek meant something considerably more than being one later on :-).

## Books not read

### A brief history of seven killings - Marlon James

![A brief history of seven killings cover](images/books/a_brief_history_of_seven_killings.jpg "A brief history of seven killings cover")

*Decided to check out this book after an endorsement from Richard Morgan:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fuck me - only 8 pages into <a href="https://twitter.com/MarlonJames5">@MarlonJames5</a> Brief History and I&#39;m trembling with the force of it; not read anything this intense in YEARS!</p>&mdash; Richard Morgan (@quellist1) <a href="https://twitter.com/quellist1/status/690880194819821568">23 January 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I am sure that in some years from now we will have people whose "best" books
will be: Takeshi Kovacs trilogy, "*Neuromancer*", "*A brief history...*" and
people will wander how cyberpunk and Jamaica mix. Remember you read it first
from me!

The other two factors that brought me to Foyle's looking for it was first
realising that I knew nothing abour Jamaica, apart from Red Stripe, that girl
rubbing against me on the Portobello carnival and a couple of people I know that
are second generation though. The second reason was the interviews and
discussions of the author on YouTube.

Dropped it in the middle, could not digest it. The trip up to then was ver fast,
very condensed, very brutal, very honest, very everything.

What makes it special: Patwa/Patois the local Jamaican dialect. Each chapter is
from the point of view of each book's character. The local drug enforcer thinks
with the local dialect a lot and his mind is messed up, another girl thinks
locally but her thoughts are clear, a CIA opeative speaks conventional English
and so on.

A very interesting device is the utilisation of cyclical story telling, which
is the way Jamaican story telling works (got this from the YouTube interview),
so is the narration. Totally unconventional but interleaved with the thought
patterns of the characters. So strong that decided to utilise it for some of my
blog writing.

Why I couldn't finish it: Read the first part which is set in 1976 and the
beginning of the second set in 1976. From there I just could not push further.
Guess I got too much of an intake. Since . Also I cannot easily remember names,
I started losing the plot. Last I have a roughly 300 pages rule for a fiction
books, this one is about 700 pages. After some time I had some fatigue, wanted
to get back to reading something non-fiction. So decided that it would be best
to stop and  come back at some point in the future, something that was also the
approach that  some people on Goodreads took as well. Then I will also try to
read summaries and material on the people and the places to get a grip on the
parts of the plot that slipped.

From the reader's perspective, I still have not managed to scan books and only
concentrate on the interesting parts for me. There is still the read from cover
to cover mentality which I haven't let go. Maybe this book is not a proper
candidate for a start though...

### Blockchain Revolution - Don Tapscott, Alex Tapscott

Used [rule 50](http://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/178273167) and decided to drop it, apart from reading random pages, keeping a copy of the table of contents, and some notes here and there. Too much discussion about hype, no simplified mathematics or something similar which would help me understand how this blockchain thing "works". More like it is here it will change our lives verything is awesome - Hooray type of stuff.

Mayne the author has done a good work and I missed it. I would prefer to start with a blockchain appication, explain how it works and then follow up with how this changes the way business is conducted, business culture, etc. Or later on how the initial chain would compare with others, say Bitcoin vs Ethereum. Maybe not for me.
