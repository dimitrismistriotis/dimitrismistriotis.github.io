# Books of 2016

## 1. "Broken angels" - Richard Morgan

<img alt="" src="http://www.richardkmorgan.com/wp-content/uploads/broken_angels_UK_Hb.jpg" title="Broken angels cover" class="book_post" />

Richard Morgan is the only author whose books I try to read twice. I had read
"Broken angels" more than five years before and apart from a very few scenes I
remembered next to nothing. Follow up to "Altered carbon" with Takeshi Kovacs
in a planet far away from earth in a totally different adventure (no spoilers).
Tough but rewarding page turner. Wanted to read so much that I was just
devouring it, missing less details of the story than the first time and
possibly more than the third if there will ever be one.

The universe of the Kovacs trilogy is unique in it's world building although
a "proper" dystopia, Moran makes me want to be in one of it's planets for a
while. Difficult to digest the concept of "re-sleeving" but while writing these
lines my head is is still full of futuristic weapons, interstellar travel,
Marian spaceships, private armies, religious fanatics, cloak and dagger
betrayal, corporate executives and so many other things on which I will try
not to dwell so that I will not reveal any details of the plot. I really liked
the fact that it's plot is set somewhere far away from planet Earth which I
usually treat as an short-cut from building a good science fiction world,
something that many books suffer from with the previous one "Altered carbon"
of course **excluded**.

On the topic of comparing it with "Alter..." many people found this one somehow
inferior mostly because some of their favourite elements from that one are not
here. I found both books on the same level. I would really favour this one,
if I had to choose between the two, without pushing myself to do so because I
am a fan of the author. The first book had elements and a plot that appeal to a
wider audience, with the second one appealing more to people that enjoy the
specific genre be it science fiction or cyberpunk or dystopian future whatever.

Third and last of the series, "Woken furies", will have to wait for a prolonged
period of free time such as a holiday, since it's size scares me.

## 02 DO/Story/ "How to tell your story so the world listens" - Bobette Buster

Was lucky enough to listen to a speech from the book's author at the end of last year on which I could get a "How to tell..." copy for my to-read list, which I am currently cleaning up. Hope was to assist in improving my writing.

"How to tell..." is an introduction/tour to the art of story telling from a Hollywood-ish angle. Useful as I decided to use the suggested exercises and suggestions for my own writing and blog posts. Book is small in size but packed with the mechanics of story telling, flavoured with stories from the author's and her students' lives as well as from memorable films.

Might check out other books from the same series as the size/utility ratio is intriguing.

## 03 "Getting past no" - William Ury

This one was a gift that ended up on my "to read" stack, because of an interest that I had expressed in negotiation literature. I started reading it in order to look cool to the person who gave it to me, but luckily I got hooked.

In the first chapters Ury discusses on what you should never do when negotiations go south. It was essentially an enumeration on what I was doing before in the similar occasions so that grabbed my attention. Later on the book discusses it's main subject on how to drive a negotiation with a very negative opponent, following the book's terminology. How to stay calm, where I used to suck, disarm the toxicity, reframe the discussion and so forth.

Having been exposed to "Getting more", "past no" gave insights on these corner cases that do not seem to make sense, happen more often than we thing they should and offer a way to encounter them.

## 04 "In search of forever" - Rodney Matthews

![In search of forever](/images/in_search_of_forever.jpg "In search of forever cover")

You do not exactly read a book of illustrations but this one is a little
different since it has extensive and thorough descriptions from the person
resposible for tons of stuff that I loved as a kid such as fantasy book covers
and record covers. Bought this in a used book store in a magic place called
Camden. What drew me to it was the fact that I always remembered the covers of
"Praying mantis" records' while at the same time do not remember their sound.
Moorcock's illustrations follow. Liked reading the stories behind magnificent
70s/80s stuff and will definitely be coming back every once in a while to
check them out again.

## 05 "The new hardboiled web design" - Andy Clarke

![Hardboiled web design cover](images/hardboiled-web-design-andy-clarke-cover_large.png "Hardboiled web design cover")

I decided that I wanted to update my HTML5 knowledge and get up to speed with
the latest developments, mainly HTML5 and CSS3. Being aware of the remarkable
quality of Smashing magazine's printed material along with wanting to compensate
them for all the great material that they produced, I bought it. It was not
exactly what I was looking for, it was way way more!

Although what I needed was there, it was a very small subset of that the book is
about. Andy Clarke takes though his methodology of web design. Instead of the
now outdated "graceful degradation", he suggest a "progressive enhancement"
approach, allowing browsers who support novel features to do so, without
breaking the experience for those who do not (yet). This allows to start from
plain HTML and CSS and create stunning results without frameworks and almost
from scratch. This is one element of the "hardboiled" that triggered a paradigm
shift and provided lots of food for thought. There is a lot of other content and
items covered, I really managed to learn how to align flexboxed content :-).

I would really want to use the hardboiled approach in a future project after
finishing the book. Reading "Hardboiled" really made me wish I had more time in
my hands to learn deeper and do more around web design, hope the opportunity
will arise in the near future.

## Books not read

### "A brief history of seven killings" - Marlon James

![A brief history of seven killings cover](images/books/a_brief_history_of_seven_killings.jpg "A brief history of seven killings cover")

*Decided to check out this book after an endorsement from Richard Morgan:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fuck me - only 8 pages into <a href="https://twitter.com/MarlonJames5">@MarlonJames5</a> Brief History and I&#39;m trembling with the force of it; not read anything this intense in YEARS!</p>&mdash; Richard Morgan (@quellist1) <a href="https://twitter.com/quellist1/status/690880194819821568">23 January 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I am sure that in some years from now we will have people whose "best" books
will be: Takeshi Kovacs trilogy, "*Neuromancer*", "*A brief history...*" and
people will wander how cyberpunk and Jamaica mix. Remember you read it first
from me!

Dropped it in the middle. Sure it is a master piece but also very hard to digest. The book was brought to attention from a Richard Morgan's tweet (XXXX). I realised that I didn't know anything about the Carribean nor had read anything. After seeing some interviews of Marlon James on Youtube, I decided to try it.
Very fast, very condensed, very brutal, very honest, very everything.
What makes it special: Patwa/Patois the local Jamaican dialect. We see things from the perspective of the characters on the book. The local enforcer thinks a bit swallow and uses the dialect a lot, the CIA opeative speaks conventional English and thinks alike. A very interesting texnasma is that because Jamaican story telling is cyclical, so is the narration. Totally unconvetional but also makes sense: the beginning/middle/end distinction is many times blurry at least. This has influenced some of my blog writing.
Why I couldn't finish it: Read the first part which is set in 1976 and some of the second - book is in 4 parts set in 1976, 1979, 80s and 90s - where I just could not push further. Got too much of an intake I guess. Also I am cannot remember and maintain names easily so I started loosing the plot. Last but not least I have a 300 pages rule for a fictional book. This book is about 700 pages. Decided that it would be best to stop and then come back at some point in the future, which is something that as I saw happened to some people on Goodreads who also did the same.


From the reader's perspective, I should scan the book more than try to digest it, specially in parts where I could not try or apply what I was reading. It seems that the read it all cover to cover mentality, although a bit less strong is still prevelant.
