# Books of 2016

## 01. "Broken angels" - Richard Morgan

<img alt="" src="http://www.richardkmorgan.com/wp-content/uploads/broken_angels_UK_Hb.jpg" title="Broken angels cover" class="book_post" />

Richard Morgan is the only author whose books I try to read twice. I had read
"Broken angels" more than five years before and apart from a very few scenes I
remembered next to nothing. Follow up to "Altered carbon" with Takeshi Kovacs
in a planet far away from earth in a totally different adventure (no spoilers).
Tough but rewarding page turner. Wanted to read so much that I was just
devouring it, missing less details of the story than the first time and
possibly more than the third if there will ever be one.

The universe of the Kovacs trilogy is unique in it's world building although
a "proper" dystopia, Moran makes me want to be in one of it's planets for a
while. Difficult to digest the concept of "re-sleeving" but while writing these
lines my head is is still full of futuristic weapons, interstellar travel,
Marian spaceships, private armies, religious fanatics, cloak and dagger
betrayal, corporate executives and so many other things on which I will try
not to dwell so that I will not reveal any details of the plot. I really liked
the fact that it's plot is set somewhere far away from planet Earth which I
usually treat as an short-cut from building a good science fiction world,
something that many books suffer from with the previous one "Altered carbon"
of course **excluded**.

On the topic of comparing it with "Alter..." many people found this one somehow
inferior mostly because some of their favourite elements from that one are not
here. I found both books on the same level. I would really favour this one,
if I had to choose between the two, without pushing myself to do so because I
am a fan of the author. The first book had elements and a plot that appeal to a
wider audience, with the second one appealing more to people that enjoy the
specific genre be it science fiction or cyberpunk or dystopian future whatever.

Third and last of the series, "Woken furies", will have to wait for a prolonged
period of free time such as a holiday, since it's size scares me.

## 02. DO/Story/ "How to tell your story so the world listens" - Bobette Buster

<img alt="" src="http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0176/9202/products/Story_c7063825-1738-4b76-a94b-70cb6bff84a2_large.jpg" title="How to tell your story so the world listens" class="book_post" />

Was lucky enough to listen to a speech from the book's author at the end of last year on which I could get a "How to tell..." copy for my to-read list, which I am currently cleaning up. Hope was to assist in improving my writing.

"How to tell..." is an introduction/tour to the art of story telling from a Hollywood-ish angle. Useful as I decided to use the suggested exercises and suggestions for my own writing and blog posts. Book is small in size but packed with the mechanics of story telling, flavoured with stories from the author's and her students' lives as well as from memorable films.

Might check out other books from the same series as the size/utility ratio is intriguing.

## 03. "Getting past no" - William Ury

This one was a gift that ended up on my "to read" stack, because of an interest that I had expressed in negotiation literature. I started reading it in order to look cool to the person who gave it to me, but luckily I got hooked.

In the first chapters Ury discusses on what you should never do when negotiations go south. It was essentially an enumeration on what I was doing before in the similar occasions so that grabbed my attention. Later on the book discusses it's main subject on how to drive a negotiation with a very negative opponent, following the book's terminology. How to stay calm, where I used to suck, disarm the toxicity, reframe the discussion and so forth.

Having been exposed to "Getting more", "past no" gave insights on these corner cases that do not seem to make sense, happen more often than we thing they should and offer a way to encounter them.

## 04. "In search of forever" - Rodney Matthews

![In search of forever](/images/in_search_of_forever.jpg "In search of forever cover")

You do not exactly read a book of illustrations but this one is a little
different since it has extensive and thorough descriptions from the person
resposible for tons of stuff that I loved as a kid such as fantasy book covers
and record covers. Bought this in a used book store in a magic place called
Camden. What drew me to it was the fact that I always remembered the covers of
"Praying mantis" records' while at the same time do not remember their sound.
Moorcock's illustrations follow. Liked reading the stories behind magnificent
70s/80s stuff and will definitely be coming back every once in a while to
check them out again.

## 05. "The new hardboiled web design" - Andy Clarke

![Hardboiled web design cover](images/hardboiled-web-design-andy-clarke-cover_large.png "Hardboiled web design cover")

I decided that I wanted to update my HTML5 knowledge and get up to speed with
the latest developments, mainly HTML5 and CSS3. Being aware of the remarkable
quality of Smashing magazine's printed material along with wanting to compensate
them for all the great material that they produced, I bought it. It was not
exactly what I was looking for, it was way way more!

Although what I needed was there, it was a very small subset of that the book is
about. Andy Clarke takes though his methodology of web design. Instead of the
now outdated "graceful degradation", he suggest a "progressive enhancement"
approach, allowing browsers who support novel features to do so, without
breaking the experience for those who do not (yet). This allows to start from
plain HTML and CSS and create stunning results without frameworks and almost
from scratch. This is one element of the "hardboiled" that triggered a paradigm
shift and provided lots of food for thought. There is a lot of other content and
items covered, I really managed to learn how to align flexboxed content :-).

I would really want to use the hardboiled approach in a future project after
finishing the book. Reading "Hardboiled" really made me wish I had more time in
my hands to learn deeper and do more around web design, hope the opportunity
will arise in the near future.

### 06. "The broken sword" - Poul Anderson

![The broken sword cover](images/books/broken_sword.jpg "The broken sword cover")

Second recommendation from Richard Morgan who brought the book to my radar. Mindblowing and amazing on how a person could put such a dense story in about 200 pages. Made me see norse/British mythology from a totally different angle. Trivia: The sword of the book is the inspiration for Moorcock's Stormbringer. Page turner, necessary, wish was exposed to such master pieces earlier.

Also it seems that covers have deteriorated over the years. I bought a 70s paperback which has the wonderful cover as seen above while the contemporary one looks like an abstract nothingness... Why?

## Books not read

### "A brief history of seven killings" - Marlon James

![A brief history of seven killings cover](images/books/a_brief_history_of_seven_killings.jpg "A brief history of seven killings cover")

*Decided to check out this book after an endorsement from Richard Morgan:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fuck me - only 8 pages into <a href="https://twitter.com/MarlonJames5">@MarlonJames5</a> Brief History and I&#39;m trembling with the force of it; not read anything this intense in YEARS!</p>&mdash; Richard Morgan (@quellist1) <a href="https://twitter.com/quellist1/status/690880194819821568">23 January 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I am sure that in some years from now we will have people whose "best" books
will be: Takeshi Kovacs trilogy, "*Neuromancer*", "*A brief history...*" and
people will wander how cyberpunk and Jamaica mix. Remember you read it first
from me!

The other two factors that brought me to Foyle's looking for it was first
realising that I knew nothing abour Jamaica, apart from Red Stripe, that girl
rubbing against me on the Portobello carnival and a couple of people I know that
are second generation though. The second reason was the interviews and
discussions of the author on YouTube.

Dropped it in the middle, could not digest it. The trip up to then was ver fast,
very condensed, very brutal, very honest, very everything.

What makes it special: Patwa/Patois the local Jamaican dialect. Each chapter is
from the point of view of each book's character. The local drug enforcer thinks
with the local dialect a lot and his mind is messed up, another girl thinks
locally but her thoughts are clear, a CIA opeative speaks conventional English
and so on.

A very interesting device is the utilisation of cyclical story telling, which
is the way Jamaican story telling works (got this from the YouTube interview),
so is the narration. Totally unconvetional but interweaved with the thought
patterns of the characters. So strong that decided to utilise it for some of my
blog writing.

Why I couldn't finish it: Read the first part which is set in 1976 and the
beginning of the second set in 1976. From there I just could not push further.
Guess I got too much of an intake. Since . Also I cannot easily remember names,
I started losing the plot. Last I have a roughly 300 pages rule for a fiction
books, this one is about 700 pages. After some time I had some fatigue, wanted
to get back to reading something non-fiction. So decided that it would be best
to stop and  come back at some point in the future, something that was also the
approach that  some people on Goodreads took as well. Then I will also try to
read summaries and material on the people and the places to get a grip on the
parts of the plot that slipped.

From the reader's perspective, I still have not managed to scan books and only
concentrate on the interesting parts for me. There is still the read from cover
to cover mentatllity which I haven't let go. Maybe this book is not a proper
candidate for a start though...
