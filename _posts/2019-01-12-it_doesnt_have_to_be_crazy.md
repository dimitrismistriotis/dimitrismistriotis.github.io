# It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work - Notes and Review

## Your Company is Your Product

Maybe the most important chapter in the book. It is almost sad that it is placed
so early with its value being proportionally way more than other ones.

The premise is that a company's culture should be treated as "code",
experimented with, tweaked, improved, in one word **malleable** which is
something that the vast majority of companies refuse to accept. As they discuss
later in the book, their company has changed scope, rules, holiday planning and
allowance, perks, salary structure, pricing many times and will continue to do
so in the future. This is their approach, another one is suggested at the end
of this section for completeness and food for thought.

In most companies people live under the tyranny, or stupidity based on your
perspective, of "this is how we do it here". At some point in time founders or
early employees set up a set of rules, people then follow them blindly without
asking or challenging the whys, hows, or just if some things make sense.
I use to call the people who set-up the corporate culture never to be changed
again, probably against their intention, as "founding fathers", with employees
afterwards following that rule-set as "gospel".

Some times when poo hits the fan an external consultant person or firm is hired
only to say, without having access of course to the material, things people say
on their exit interviews. It is always funny at times when it is not tragic.

Another antidote to that apart from what the authors suggestions is to treat
decisions as time-bound, something that happens in many laws and executive
orders around the world in the legal/government domain. For example: "this is
our holiday policy and we will review it in 3 years from now say if we are
in March 2010, at March 2013." or "Because we need to be very thorough every
code submission needs to be reviewed by 3 people, in 6 months from now the
number will return to 2 without the need to notify anyone", or even better:
"we decided on this technological stack, we will review this decision every
5 years".
